## Disease Overview

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited disorder in which the heart muscle becomes hypertrophied, or grows thicker than it should be. It occurs in about 1 in 500 adults. Though many people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy lead normal lives with few limitations, there is the potential for developing severe symptoms and serious heart-related complications, including [heart failure](https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/congestive-heart-failure) [1], [arrhythmia](https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/heart-arrhythmia) [1], and even sudden cardiac death.

The heart is made up of four chambers—two upper atria and two lower ventricles—that work together to pump blood to the body. In people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the wall of the left ventricle contracts very strongly and becomes thicker than usual. This can impair the heart's ability to pump blood efficiently, leading to heart failure. In some cases, the thickening can obstruct blood flow out of the ventricle, a condition known as obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. [1]

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is often inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, with about 60% of cases having a known gene mutation. However, in up to 40% of cases, the cause is unknown. [2][3][4] It can present at any age, from infancy to older adulthood, and affects males and females equally. [1][11]

## Potential Pathogens

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is primarily caused by genetic mutations, but viral infections can also contribute to the development of this condition. Some of the common pathogens that have been associated with HCM include:

[1] Viral infections:
- Coxsackievirus
- Adenovirus 
- Epstein-Barr virus
- Influenza virus
- Parvovirus
- Hepatitis viruses (A and C)
- COVID-19 virus

[2] Bacterial infections:
- Streptococcus species
- Staphylococcus species
- Enterococcus species

[3] Other infections:
- Chagas disease (caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi)

Viral infections can directly damage the heart muscle and trigger an inflammatory response, leading to the development of myocarditis and subsequent cardiac hypertrophy. Bacterial infections can also cause infective endocarditis, which can contribute to the progression of HCM. 

Additionally, some patients with HCM may have a predisposing factor for bacteremia, such as a recent invasive procedure, which can increase their risk of developing infective endocarditis.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common heart disease in cats, affecting up to 1 in 7 cats [1]. Many cats with HCM, especially those with mild to moderate disease, show no clinical signs [1,4]. However, cats that develop severe HCM may exhibit signs of congestive heart failure, such as labored or rapid breathing, open-mouthed breathing, and lethargy [1,3]. 

A serious complication of HCM is the formation of blood clots in the heart, which can then travel and obstruct blood flow in other parts of the body, commonly resulting in sudden hind limb paralysis [1,3,4]. Cats with HCM are also at risk of sudden cardiac death [1,3].

On physical examination, veterinarians may detect abnormal heart sounds, including a soft to prominent systolic cardiac murmur and/or a gallop sound [1,4]. However, at least one-third of cats with HCM do not have a detectable murmur [4].

## Diagnostic Methods

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is typically diagnosed through a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging tests, and genetic testing. The key diagnostic methods include:

[1] Echocardiography: This is the primary imaging test used to diagnose HCM. Echocardiography can identify left ventricular hypertrophy, assess the degree of outflow tract obstruction, and evaluate mitral valve function. [2]

[2] Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR): CMR provides superior visualization of the heart's structure and can identify morphological variants of HCM that may be missed on echocardiography. CMR can also assess myocardial fibrosis, which has prognostic implications. [2,5]

[3] Electrocardiogram (ECG): ECG is often abnormal in HCM patients, with findings such as left ventricular hypertrophy, repolarization changes, and q-waves. However, ECG findings lack specificity for definitively diagnosing HCM. [2,6]

[4] Genetic Testing: Genetic testing can identify disease-causing mutations in sarcomere protein genes associated with HCM. This can be useful for screening first-degree relatives of HCM patients. However, a genetic cause is not identified in all HCM cases. [2,3]

[5] Exercise Testing: Treadmill or bicycle exercise testing can be used to evaluate dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, which may not be evident at rest. [2,18]

[6] Ambulatory ECG Monitoring: 24-48 hour Holter monitoring is recommended in all HCM patients to assess for ventricular arrhythmias, which can increase the risk of sudden cardiac death. [2,28,29]

Overall, a comprehensive evaluation incorporating clinical history, physical exam, and multimodality imaging is necessary to accurately diagnose HCM and guide appropriate management.

## Treatment Options

Medications

The primary treatment options for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are medications like beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. These medications can help reduce the heart's contraction and slow the heart rate, allowing the heart to pump blood better. [1]

Beta-blockers are the first-line treatment for HCM symptoms. Some common beta-blockers used include metoprolol, atenolol, and propranolol. [1]

Calcium channel blockers like verapamil and diltiazem may be used as an alternative or in addition to beta-blockers, especially for patients who do not tolerate beta-blockers well. [1]

The antiarrhythmic drug disopyramide may also be used if beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers fail to control symptoms. [1]

Mavacamten is a new medication recently approved by the FDA to treat symptomatic obstructive HCM. It works by decreasing the heart's contraction. Clinical trials have shown it can improve symptoms and exercise capacity in HCM patients. [1]

Lifestyle Changes

Lifestyle changes can also help manage HCM symptoms. Patients are advised to avoid strenuous exercise and stay well hydrated, as dehydration can worsen symptoms. [1]

Procedures and Surgeries

If medications are unable to control HCM symptoms, more invasive procedures may be recommended:

- Septal reduction therapy: This includes alcohol septal ablation and septal myectomy, which involve removing part of the thickened heart muscle to improve blood flow. [1]

- Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD): For patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death, an ICD may be implanted to monitor the heart rhythm and deliver shocks to stop dangerous arrhythmias. [1]

- Heart transplant: For patients with end-stage HCM and severe heart failure, a heart transplant may be considered. [2]

## Preventive Measures

Individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) can take several preventive measures to manage their condition and reduce the risk of complications:

Diet and Nutrition: Following a heart-healthy diet low in sodium, saturated fats, and added sugars can help manage blood pressure and cholesterol levels.[1] This may involve eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, nuts, and fish.

Exercise: Moderate-intensity exercises like walking, yoga, and tai chi are generally recommended for HCM patients, as high-intensity activities could strain the heart. Exercise should be discussed with a cardiologist to develop a safe and effective plan.[1,2]

Weight Management: Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce stress on the heart and lower the risk of other conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes that can worsen HCM.[1]

Stress Management: Techniques like meditation, deep breathing, and relaxation exercises can help manage stress, which is important for HCM as it can trigger abnormal heart rhythms.[1]

Sleep: Getting adequate, high-quality sleep is crucial, as poor sleep can negatively impact heart health.[1]

Smoking Cessation: Quitting smoking is important, as it can worsen HCM symptoms and increase the risk of heart disease.[1]

Alcohol Moderation: Limiting alcohol intake, as excessive alcohol can raise blood pressure and worsen heart function.[1]

Regular Check-ups: Seeing a cardiologist regularly for monitoring and adjustments to treatment is essential for managing HCM.[1,2]

By following these preventive measures, individuals with HCM can help control their symptoms, reduce the risk of complications, and maintain a good quality of life.

## Differential Diagnosis

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) can present similarly to several other conditions that can cause left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). It is important to distinguish HCM from these mimics, as their prognosis and management differ significantly. 

Some key conditions that can mimic HCM include:

1. **Hypertensive Heart Disease**: LVH secondary to hypertension can overlap with the patterns of hypertrophy seen in non-obstructive HCM. However, features like systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve and dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction are less common in hypertensive heart disease. Specialized imaging techniques like tissue Doppler and strain imaging can help differentiate the two.

2. **Athlete's Heart**: Intense exercise training can lead to physiologic LVH, which can overlap with milder forms of HCM. A detailed family history, electrocardiogram, and assessment of cardiac function can help distinguish pathologic HCM from the athlete's heart.

3. **Infiltrative Disorders**: Conditions like cardiac amyloidosis, Fabry disease, and Danon disease can present with LVH that resembles HCM. However, these often have additional systemic features and a more aggressive clinical course. Specific diagnostic testing like genetic analysis and cardiac imaging (e.g. cardiac MRI) are crucial.

4. **Metabolic Disorders**: Glycogen storage diseases like Pompe, Danon, and PRKAG2 cardiomyopathy can mimic HCM. These conditions are typically associated with rapid progression to systolic dysfunction, conduction abnormalities, and multisystem involvement.

In summary, a high index of suspicion for HCM mimics is important, especially when the clinical presentation or family history is atypical. A multimodal approach using echocardiography, cardiac MRI, genetic testing, and screening of family members is crucial to establish the correct diagnosis and guide appropriate management.
