## Disease Overview

A corneal ulcer is an open sore on the cornea, the clear front layer of the eye. Corneal ulcers are usually caused by infections, which can be bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoal in nature. They are considered a medical emergency as they can lead to vision loss and blindness if left untreated. 

The cornea contains six layers - the epithelium, Bowman's membrane, the stroma, Dua's layer, Descemet's membrane, and the endothelium. Corneal ulcers are classified based on the underlying cause, location, and depth of involvement. Common predisposing factors include ocular trauma, dry eyes, contact lens wear, and systemic conditions like diabetes and immunosuppression. 

The annual incidence of corneal ulcers in the United States is estimated to be between 30,000 and 75,000 cases, with 12.2% of all corneal transplants performed for the management of infectious keratitis. Prompt recognition and treatment are critical to prevent vision-threatening complications like scarring, perforation, glaucoma, and endophthalmitis.

## Common Pathogens

Corneal ulcers can be caused by a variety of infectious agents, including:

[1] Bacterial infections: The most common bacterial pathogens that can cause corneal ulcers are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus species, and Streptococcus species. These are often seen in contact lens wearers, especially with extended wear or poor lens hygiene. [1]

[2] Viral infections: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common cause of viral keratitis and a leading cause of unilateral infectious corneal blindness in developed countries. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and cytomegalovirus can also cause viral keratitis, though less commonly. [2]

[3] Fungal infections: Fungal etiologies account for 5-10% of corneal infections, and are more common in warmer, humid climates. The most commonly implicated fungi include Aspergillus, Fusarium, Scedosporium apiospermum, phaeohyphomycetes, Candida albicans and other Candida species. Fungal keratitis is often precipitated by corneal trauma involving plant material. [3]

[4] Protozoan infections: Acanthamoeba, a free-living protozoan found in freshwater and soil, can cause keratitis and corneal ulcers, primarily in contact lens wearers. [4]

[5] Pythium infection: Pythium keratitis is a recently recognized, vision-threatening keratitis caused by the oomycete protozoan Pythium insidiosum. [5,6,7,8]

In addition to infectious causes, noninfectious conditions such as autoimmune diseases, dry eye, and eyelid abnormalities can also lead to corneal ulcers.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Corneal ulcers typically present with a range of symptoms that can vary depending on the underlying cause. The most common symptoms include:

[1] Redness of the eye: Corneal ulcers often cause significant circumcorneal conjunctival hyperemia and redness of the eye.

[2] Severe eye pain and discomfort: Patients frequently experience intense eye pain, a foreign body sensation, and photophobia. The level of pain can be an important clue to the underlying etiology, with conditions like Acanthamoeba keratitis often causing severe pain disproportionate to the clinical appearance.

[3] Tearing and discharge: Excessive tearing and ocular discharge, which may be watery or purulent, are common with corneal ulcers. 

[4] Blurred vision: The ulceration and inflammation can lead to decreased visual acuity and blurred vision.

On slit lamp examination, the corneal ulcer typically appears as a corneal epithelial defect that stains with fluorescein, with an underlying dull, grayish, circumscribed opacity representing the stromal infiltrate. More severe ulcers may spread to involve the entire width of the cornea, penetrate deeply, or result in the development of a hypopyon (layered white blood cells in the anterior chamber). In chronic cases, blood vessel ingrowth from the limbus (corneal neovascularization) may be observed.

The specific clinical appearance can provide clues to the underlying etiology. For example, fungal ulcers often have a dry, raised appearance with feathery margins, while viral ulcers (such as from herpes simplex) may exhibit a characteristic dendritic pattern. Acanthamoeba keratitis can present with multiple stromal infiltrates in a ring-shaped configuration and severe pain. Ultimately, a detailed history, slit lamp examination, and appropriate diagnostic testing are required to make an accurate diagnosis.

## Diagnostic Methods

Clinicians use a variety of diagnostic approaches to evaluate corneal ulcers and determine the underlying cause. A thorough patient history and clinical examination are essential first steps.

When taking the patient history, it is important to inquire about risk factors such as contact lens wear, recent eye trauma, and underlying systemic conditions like diabetes or autoimmune disorders. The clinician should also assess the quality and severity of the patient's symptoms, including pain, photophobia, and vision changes.

The clinical examination involves a detailed slit lamp examination to evaluate the size, location, and characteristics of the ulcer. Key findings can include epithelial defects, stromal infiltrates, necrosis, and anterior chamber reaction. Fluorescein staining can help highlight the extent of the epithelial defect.

Laboratory testing is often required to identify the causative organism. This typically involves culturing corneal scrapings on various agar media to detect bacterial, fungal, or protozoal infections. Staining techniques like Gram stain and potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation can also provide initial clues. More advanced testing like PCR may be needed to detect viral pathogens.

In some cases, advanced imaging modalities like confocal microscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) can provide additional information about the depth and extent of corneal involvement. These techniques are particularly useful for diagnosing atypical infections like Acanthamoeba.

Overall, a stepwise diagnostic approach incorporating history, clinical exam, and targeted laboratory/imaging studies is essential to accurately identify the underlying cause of a corneal ulcer and guide appropriate treatment. Prompt diagnosis and management are critical to prevent serious complications like vision loss or globe perforation.

## Treatment Options

Antibiotic eye drops are often the first-line treatment for bacterial corneal ulcers. Broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotics like ciprofloxacin or moxifloxacin are commonly prescribed. [1] For larger or more severe ulcers, fortified antibiotics like vancomycin and tobramycin may be added. [1]

Antiviral eye drops like trifluridine or acyclovir are used to treat viral infections, particularly from the herpes simplex virus. [1] Antifungal medications like natamycin are prescribed for fungal keratitis. [1] 

Corticosteroid eye drops can help reduce inflammation, but their use is controversial as they may worsen infections if not paired with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. [1] Immunosuppressants like cyclosporine or biologics may be used for autoimmune-related corneal ulcers. [1]

In severe cases, surgical interventions like corneal transplantation may be necessary if the ulcer does not respond to medical treatment or if there is risk of perforation. [1]

The key is to identify the underlying cause through careful examination and testing, and then tailor the treatment accordingly. Close monitoring and prompt adjustment of the treatment regimen is crucial to prevent vision-threatening complications. [1,2]

## Preventive Measures

Preventing corneal ulcers involves adopting good eye care practices and being mindful of potential risk factors. If you wear contact lenses, it's crucial to maintain proper hygiene by washing your hands before handling your lenses and ensuring that you clean and store them according to your eye care professional's recommendations. Avoid wearing lenses while swimming or using hot tubs, as exposure to contaminated water can increase your risk of developing an infection.

Additionally, protecting your eyes from injuries is essential in preventing corneal ulcers. Wearing protective eyewear during activities that pose a risk of eye injury—such as sports or working with hazardous materials—can significantly reduce your chances of sustaining an injury that could lead to an ulcer. Regular eye examinations are also vital for maintaining overall eye health; during these visits, your eye care provider can monitor any changes in your vision or detect early signs of potential issues.

By taking these preventive measures and being proactive about your eye health, you can significantly reduce your risk of developing corneal ulcers and maintain clear, healthy vision.

## Differential Diagnosis

Corneal ulcers can be differentiated from other eye conditions with similar symptoms in the following ways:

**Corneal Abrasion**
- Corneal abrasion is a superficial scratch or scrape on the corneal surface, whereas a corneal ulcer is a deeper open sore.
- Corneal abrasions typically heal on their own within a few days, while corneal ulcers require more intensive treatment.
- Symptoms of a corneal abrasion include pain, redness, tearing, and sensitivity to light, but the symptoms are usually less severe than with a corneal ulcer.

**Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye)**
- Conjunctivitis causes the entire eye to appear red and irritated, while a corneal ulcer is a localized open sore on the cornea.
- Conjunctivitis is often accompanied by increased eye discharge, while a corneal ulcer may have pus or other discharge but the eye is not as diffusely red.
- Conjunctivitis is typically less painful than a corneal ulcer.

**Dry Eye**
- Dry eye can cause symptoms like irritation, redness, and blurred vision, similar to a corneal ulcer.
- However, dry eye does not typically cause an open sore on the cornea like a corneal ulcer.
- Dry eye is often a chronic condition, while a corneal ulcer appears suddenly.

**Herpes Simplex Keratitis**
- Herpes simplex keratitis can cause a dendritic (branch-like) ulcer on the cornea, which is distinct from the more diffuse infiltrate and open sore of a bacterial or fungal corneal ulcer.
- Herpes simplex keratitis is caused by a viral infection, while most corneal ulcers are caused by bacterial, fungal, or other microbial infections.
- Herpes simplex keratitis often has a history of recurrent flare-ups, which is less common with other types of corneal ulcers.
