## Disease Overview

Corneal ulcers are a common and potentially serious ophthalmic condition in dogs and cats. A corneal ulcer is a defect in the corneal epithelium that exposes the underlying corneal stroma. Corneal ulcers can result from a variety of causes and can lead to significant discomfort, vision impairment, and even blindness if not promptly and appropriately managed.

The cornea is the transparent, avascular structure forming the anterior wall of the eye. It consists of several layers, including the epithelium, stroma, Descemet's membrane, and endothelium. The cornea plays a crucial role in focusing light into the eye and maintaining visual acuity.

Corneal ulcers are a common presenting complaint in veterinary ophthalmology. They can develop due to trauma, infections, immune-mediated conditions, and other underlying diseases. Brachycephalic breeds, such as Pugs and Bulldogs, are predisposed to corneal ulcers due to their prominent eyes and decreased blink reflex.

Diagnosis of corneal ulcers typically involves a thorough ophthalmic examination, with the use of fluorescein dye to identify the extent and depth of the ulcer. Treatment aims to resolve the underlying cause, prevent infection, and promote healing. This may involve topical antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, or surgical intervention in more severe cases.

Prompt recognition and appropriate management of corneal ulcers is crucial to prevent complications, such as perforation, scarring, and vision loss. Veterinary ophthalmologists play a key role in the effective diagnosis and treatment of this common and potentially vision-threatening condition in companion animals.

## Common Pathogens

Corneal ulcers in dogs and cats can be caused by a variety of viral, bacterial, and other infectious agents. Some of the most common causative pathogens include:

[1] Viral infections, such as feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) in cats, which is considered the primary cause of corneal ulcers in felines until proven otherwise. [1]

[2] Bacterial infections, particularly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus species, and Streptococcus species, which are among the most frequently isolated bacteria from corneal ulcers in dogs. [2,3,4,10] 

[3] Fungal infections, though less common, can also lead to corneal ulcers in dogs and cats. Candida species and Rhodotorula rubra have been reported as causative agents. [10]

[4] Other underlying conditions like dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), entropion, distichiasis, and endocrine disorders can predispose pets to corneal ulceration by compromising the integrity of the cornea. [4,5]

In summary, while trauma is a common initiating factor, viral, bacterial, and fungal infections as well as various eye and systemic diseases can all contribute to the development of corneal ulcers in companion animals. Identification of the underlying cause is crucial for guiding appropriate treatment.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Corneal ulcers in pets typically present with several observable symptoms and clinical signs:

[1] Redness or swelling around the eye, sometimes accompanied by dilated blood vessels on the sclera (the white part of the eye)

[2] Tearing or unusual discharge (clear, yellow, or green)

[3] Pawing at the face or rubbing on furniture due to eye discomfort

[4] Cloudiness or a visible white spot on the eye 

[5] Sensitivity to light

These symptoms can develop suddenly or worsen over time. Even if the symptoms seem mild, corneal ulcers require prompt veterinary attention as they can escalate quickly and lead to serious complications if left untreated. Owners should watch for any of these signs and bring their pet in for examination as soon as possible.

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosing corneal ulcers involves a comprehensive approach that combines clinical examination, patient history, and laboratory testing. The key diagnostic steps include:

1. Detailed patient history: Clinicians should inquire about risk factors such as contact lens wear, trauma, and underlying medical conditions like diabetes or autoimmune disorders. This helps identify the potential cause of the ulcer. [1,2]

2. Clinical examination: Slit-lamp biomicroscopy is essential to examine the eye and assess the appearance of the ulcer. Characteristics like size, location, edge, and infiltrate can provide clues to the etiology. Fluorescein staining can help detect epithelial defects. [1,2] 

3. Corneal cultures: Culturing the corneal ulcer is crucial, especially for larger, central, or atypical ulcers. Samples are obtained by gently scraping the edge of the ulcer and inoculating various culture media, including blood, chocolate, and Sabouraud agar. This allows identification of the causative organism. [1,3,4]

4. Specialized testing: For suspected fungal or Acanthamoeba infections, confocal microscopy can be utilized to visualize the organisms within the corneal layers. This rapid, noninvasive test can supplement culture results. [2,3]

5. Staining and imaging: Gram, Giemsa, and other specialized stains on corneal scrapings can provide preliminary identification of the causative organism. B-scan ultrasonography may be used to assess for posterior segment involvement, such as endophthalmitis. [3,4]

By integrating the patient history, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings, clinicians can accurately diagnose the etiology of the corneal ulcer and guide appropriate treatment.

## Treatment Options

The treatment of corneal ulcers depends on the underlying cause. The main treatment approaches include:

[1] Antibiotics: Topical antibiotic eye drops are the first-line treatment for bacterial corneal ulcers. Fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotics like ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin are commonly used. Fortified antibiotics like vancomycin or tobramycin may be added for more severe cases. [1]

[2] Antivirals: Topical antiviral eye drops like trifluridine or acyclovir are used to treat viral corneal ulcers, especially those caused by herpes simplex virus. Oral antivirals like acyclovir or valacyclovir may also be prescribed. [1]

[3] Antifungals: The primary treatment for fungal corneal ulcers is topical natamycin, a polyene antifungal medication. Amphotericin B and newer triazole antifungals may also be used. [1]

[4] Antiprotozoals: Acanthamoeba keratitis is treated with a combination of biguanides like chlorhexidine and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) for 3-4 months. [1]

[5] Corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroids may be used adjunctively after the infection is controlled, to reduce inflammation and scarring. However, their use is controversial as they can worsen infections in some cases. [1]

[6] Surgery: In severe cases of corneal ulcers that do not respond to medical treatment, surgical interventions like corneal transplantation may be required to restore vision and prevent complications like perforation. [11]

## Preventive Measures

To prevent corneal ulcers, it is important to take the following steps:

[1] Maintain good eye hygiene, especially for contact lens wearers. This includes proper cleaning and storage of contact lenses, avoiding sleeping in contacts, and not exposing contacts to water. [6]

[2] Protect the eyes from trauma and exposure to environmental irritants such as dust, chemicals, and pollutants. Wear protective eyewear when necessary. [8]

[3] Manage underlying health conditions that increase the risk of corneal ulcers, such as dry eye syndrome, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders. Seek regular eye exams and follow recommended treatment plans. [8,9]

[4] Get vaccinated against pathogens that can cause corneal ulcers, such as the varicella-zoster virus. Vaccination can significantly reduce the risk of developing related eye infections. [13,40]

[5] Avoid using topical corticosteroids long-term without proper monitoring, as they can increase the risk of corneal ulceration. [25]

[6] Maintain good overall health and nutrition, as deficiencies in certain vitamins and nutrients can contribute to corneal health issues. [9]

By following these preventive measures, individuals can significantly reduce their risk of developing corneal ulcers and the associated complications.

## Differential Diagnosis

Corneal ulcers can have a variety of underlying causes, both infectious and non-infectious. The differential diagnosis should consider the following:

[1] Bacterial keratitis: Commonly caused by *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, and other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. These typically present with a suppurative stromal infiltrate, epithelial defect, and anterior chamber reaction.

[2] Viral keratitis: Often caused by herpes simplex virus, presenting with dendritic epithelial lesions and decreased corneal sensation. Varicella-zoster virus can also cause viral keratitis.

[3] Fungal keratitis: Typically caused by *Fusarium*, *Aspergillus*, and *Candida* species. These often have feathery borders, satellite lesions, and a dry, elevated appearance.

[4] Acanthamoeba keratitis: A rare but sight-threatening protozoan infection associated with contact lens wear. Patients experience severe pain out of proportion to clinical signs.

[5] Autoimmune-related keratitis: Peripheral ulcerative keratitis associated with rheumatoid arthritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and other connective tissue disorders. These tend to be crescent-shaped and located near the limbus.

[6] Neurotrophic keratitis: Decreased corneal sensation leads to epithelial breakdown, often with a smooth, gray, poorly demarcated ulcer.

[7] Exposure keratopathy: Caused by incomplete eyelid closure, as in lagophthalmos or facial nerve palsy, leading to desiccation and epithelial defects.

[8] Marginal keratitis: An inflammatory condition related to blepharitis, with peripheral corneal infiltrates and an overlying epithelial defect.

Careful history-taking, slit-lamp examination, and selective diagnostic testing are crucial to differentiate these various etiologies and guide appropriate management.
