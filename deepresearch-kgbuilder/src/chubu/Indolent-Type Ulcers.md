## Disease Overview

Indolent-type ulcers, also known as indolent corneal ulcers, refractory ulcers, "boxer ulcers", and spontaneous chronic corneal epithelial defects (SCCEDs), are a specific type of superficial, non-healing corneal ulcer seen primarily in middle-aged to older dogs. [1,2] These ulcers are characterized by a failure of the corneal epithelium to adhere properly to the underlying stroma, leading to chronic, recurrent epithelial defects. [3] 

Indolent ulcers typically occur spontaneously without an obvious inciting cause, though some breeds like Boxers may be predisposed. [2,4] Affected dogs often display ocular discomfort, with signs like squinting, tearing, and corneal vascularization. [2,5] These ulcers can persist for weeks or months without appropriate treatment. [2,6]

The exact underlying pathophysiology is not fully understood, but is thought to involve abnormalities in the adhesion between the corneal epithelium and stroma. [3,7] Indolent ulcers share many similarities with recurrent corneal erosions seen in humans. [3]

## Common Pathogens

Indolent-type ulcers in cats are primarily associated with viral and allergic causes, rather than bacterial infections. The most common viral pathogen linked to indolent ulcers is feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) [1]. Feline herpesvirus can cause inflammation and ulceration of the lips and oral cavity in cats.

In addition to viral causes, indolent ulcers are often linked to underlying allergic skin diseases, including flea allergy dermatitis, environmental allergies, and adverse food reactions [2,3]. The allergic response can lead to inflammation, self-trauma, and subsequent ulceration of the lips and oral tissues. Insect bite hypersensitivity, such as to mosquitoes or fleas, has also been associated with the development of indolent ulcers in some cats [2].

While bacterial infections are not the primary cause of indolent ulcers, secondary bacterial involvement is common. Cytological evaluation of the lesions often reveals the presence of bacteria, which may require targeted antibiotic therapy in addition to addressing the underlying allergic or viral trigger [3,4].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Indolent-type ulcers, such as venous, arterial, diabetic neuropathic, and sickle cell anemia-related ulcers, typically have the following clinical characteristics:

[1] Venous ulcers are located above the medial malleolus, have irregular borders, and are associated with signs of chronic venous insufficiency like dermal fibrosis, hyperpigmentation, and varicose veins. The ulcer bed contains granulation and fibrinous tissue, and pain can range from absent to severe. [1,3]

[2] Arterial ulcers have well-demarcated, punched-out borders, a necrotic base, and minimal to no exudate. They are often located distally over bony prominences and are associated with other signs of peripheral arterial disease like thin, shiny skin and weak or absent pulses. Arterial ulcers typically cause severe, constant pain. [5,6]

[3] Diabetic neuropathic ulcers occur over pressure points and bony prominences, especially on the feet. They are surrounded by callus, have undermined borders, and an necrotic ulcer bed. Sensation is often impaired, leading to these ulcers being painless. Infection is common but can be difficult to detect due to the neuropathy. [8,9]

[4] Sickle cell anemia-related ulcers are extremely painful, appear after age 10, and are most common on the medial and lateral malleoli. The clinical course is indolent, and they are associated with other manifestations of sickle cell vasculopathy. [10]

## Diagnostic Methods

Indolent-type ulcers are a special type of superficial corneal ulcer that fail to heal properly. The diagnosis of indolent ulcers relies on several key factors:

[1] Characteristic clinical presentation: Indolent ulcers are typically superficial, non-healing ulcers with loose, redundant epithelial edges. They often have a characteristic "halo" staining pattern due to fluorescein leaking under the loose epithelium. [2,3]

[2] Signalment: Indolent ulcers are most commonly seen in middle-aged to older dogs, particularly certain breeds like Boxers and Corgis. [2,3]

[3] Ease of debridement: The loose, non-adherent epithelium at the edges of indolent ulcers can be easily removed with a cotton-tipped applicator. This differentiates them from other types of ulcers where the epithelium is firmly adherent. [2,3]

[4] Lack of infection: Indolent ulcers are always superficial and non-infected. There is no stromal loss, melting, or infiltration with white blood cells, which would indicate an infected ulcer. [2,3] 

[5] Exclusion of other causes: Before diagnosing an indolent ulcer, it is critical to rule out other potential causes of non-healing such as eyelid/eyelash abnormalities, tear film deficiencies, foreign bodies, and exposure keratopathy. [2,3]

In summary, the diagnosis of indolent ulcers relies on recognizing their characteristic clinical appearance, signalment, ease of debridement, lack of infection, and excluding other underlying causes. A thorough ophthalmic examination is essential to make this determination.

## Treatment Options

The primary focus of treatment for indolent corneal ulcers is restoring the adherent layer or "glue" between the epithelium and stroma. Medical management alone is often unsuccessful. 

Surgical therapy in the form of a corneal debridement is the first step in treating indolent ulcers [1,2]. This allows the affected cells to be removed from the cornea. Once this is complete, micro abrasions are created in the corneal stroma. This allows new cells to have a place to attach as they grow across the cornea. Combined, these procedures carry a 90% success rate of healing the ulcer in 2 weeks [1]. In some cases, the procedures need to be repeated a second time for complete healing.

Often, a bandage contact lens is placed over the cornea once the procedures are complete. This will protect the ulcer as it heals and make the patient more comfortable during the healing process [1,2].

Topical as well as oral medications will be required after the procedure to protect against infection as well as control pain and inflammation. Once the ulcer is fully healed, topical anti-inflammatory drops may be recommended to decrease any scar tissue that may have formed [1].

## Preventive Measures

Guideline 1.1: Establish a repositioning schedule and avoid positioning patients on pressure ulcers and bony prominences. (Level II)

Principle: Pressure injuries are thought to result from hypoperfusion to soft tissues. Compression of soft tissues against a bony prominence may contribute to hypoperfusion. It is reasonable to assume that pressure on a pre-existing injury may result in delayed healing. Patients should be repositioned to relieve pressure over bony prominences. The exact turning interval is not known and is derived empirically. Reductions in pressure injuries have been achieved, but positioning is not universally effective.

## Differential Diagnosis

Indolent-type ulcers may co-exist with other cutaneous reaction patterns associated with hypersensitivity disorders, particularly fleabite hypersensitivity (miliary dermatitis, symmetrical alopecia) [1]. Cytology can be used to assess for the presence of any infectious agents.

Eosinophilic ulcers are typically associated with allergic skin diseases in cats, particularly flea bite hypersensitivity, but can also be observed in some cats with environmental or adverse food reactions [2]. Indolent ulcers can also develop as a result of inflammation, such as from trauma [2].

Other differential diagnoses include neoplasia (e.g. squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma, mast cell tumor) and infectious granulomas (bacterial, fungal, viral) [11,12]. A thorough diagnostic workup, including biopsy if needed, is important to rule out these more serious underlying causes.

# Indolent-Type Ulcers

Indolent-type ulcers, also known as indolent corneal ulcers, are a specific type of chronic, non-healing corneal lesion primarily seen in middle-aged to older dogs. These ulcers are characterized by a failure of the corneal epithelium to adhere properly to the underlying stroma, leading to persistent epithelial defects. While the exact underlying causes are not fully understood, predisposing factors like breed and immune dysfunction likely play a role. Careful diagnosis through clinical presentation, signalment, and ruling out other potential etiologies is crucial, as management of these challenging ulcers often requires a combination of surgical debridement, bandage contact lenses, and targeted medical therapy.

## Summary

Indolent ulcers are typically superficial, non-healing lesions with loose, redundant epithelial edges. They are most commonly seen in certain dog breeds like Boxers and Corgis. Successful management involves surgically debriding the affected cornea to remove the non-adherent epithelium and create a fresh surface for healing. Adjunct therapy with bandage contact lenses, anti-inflammatory medications, and antibiotics may also be required to promote wound closure. While the prognosis is generally good with appropriate treatment, indolent ulcers can be recurrent and frustratingly challenging to fully resolve in some patients.
