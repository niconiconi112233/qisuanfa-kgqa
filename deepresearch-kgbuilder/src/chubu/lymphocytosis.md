## Disease Overview

Lymphocytosis is a condition characterized by an increased number of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, in the blood. It can be a normal response to an infection or other health condition, or it can be a sign of a more serious underlying disease like cancer.

Lymphocytosis is relatively common in younger dogs, with one study finding that 45% of cases occurred in dogs under 3 years old. However, in adult dogs, lymphocytosis is most often associated with lymphoproliferative disorders like lymphoma or leukemia [1,2]. Other less common causes include thymoma, Addison's disease, and chronic Ehrlichia infection [3].

Symptoms of lymphocytosis may include swollen lymph nodes and an enlarged spleen, but the condition itself does not typically cause symptoms. Diagnostic tests like blood smears, flow cytometry, and clonality testing are used to determine the underlying cause [2,3]. Treatment depends on the underlying condition, and can range from monitoring for mild, non-neoplastic causes to chemotherapy for lymphoproliferative cancers.

Overall, lymphocytosis is an important finding that should prompt further investigation to identify the root cause, especially in adult dogs where it is more likely to be associated with a serious condition.

## Common Pathogens Causing Lymphocytosis in Dogs and Cats

Viral, bacterial, and other pathogens that can cause lymphocytosis in dogs and cats include:

[1] Ehrlichia canis: A tick-borne bacterial infection that can lead to a reactive expansion of CD8+ T lymphocytes, causing lymphocytosis in dogs. [1,4]

[2] Leishmania infantum: A protozoan parasite that can stimulate lymphocytes and lead to lymphocytosis in dogs. [1] 

[3] Spirocerca lupi: A parasitic worm infection that has been associated with lymphocytosis in dogs. [1]

[4] Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV): This viral infection in cats can cause polyclonal B-cell lymphocytosis. [7]

[5] Canine distemper virus: This virus can cause inclusion bodies to appear in lymphocytes, leading to lymphocytosis in dogs. [3]

In addition, other conditions that can lead to lymphocytosis include:

- Immune-mediated diseases (e.g. immune-mediated hemolytic anemia in cats) [1,7]
- Endocrine diseases like hyperthyroidism in cats and hypoadrenocorticism in dogs [1,7]
- Lymphoid neoplasia like lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia [1,7-10]
- Nonlymphoid neoplasia like thymoma [1]
- Physiologic (epinephrine-induced) response, especially in younger cats and dogs [6]

Therefore, a thorough diagnostic workup including bloodwork, cytology, flow cytometry, and potentially genetic testing is important to identify the underlying cause of lymphocytosis in dogs and cats.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Lymphocytosis, or an elevated number of lymphocytes in the blood, can present with a variety of clinical symptoms and signs in companion animals. The most common clinical signs associated with lymphocytosis include [1]:

- Lethargy and decreased activity levels
- Weight loss or poor appetite
- Enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy)
- Splenomegaly (enlarged spleen)
- Fever
- Increased susceptibility to infections

The specific clinical presentation can vary depending on the underlying cause of the lymphocytosis. For example, lymphocytosis associated with infectious diseases like ehrlichiosis or leishmaniasis may present with fever, lethargy, and lymphadenopathy [2]. In contrast, lymphocytosis related to lymphoproliferative disorders like lymphoma or leukemia may be accompanied by more generalized symptoms like weight loss, poor appetite, and organomegaly (enlarged organs) [3].

In some cases, particularly in younger dogs and cats, mild lymphocytosis may occur without any overt clinical signs. This can be due to an immune response to vaccination, exposure to novel antigens, or other benign causes [2,3]. However, persistent or marked lymphocytosis warrants further diagnostic investigation to determine the underlying etiology.

## Diagnostic Methods

Lymphocytosis, defined by an increase in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) to more than 4,000 lymphocytes/microL in adult patients, is a common hematologic abnormality. The evaluation of patients presenting with lymphocytosis begins with a detailed history and physical examination.

The complete blood count (CBC) and review of the peripheral blood smear (PBS) are essential first steps. The CBC can confirm the presence of absolute lymphocytosis and delineate abnormalities in other blood components such as hemoglobin and platelets. The PBS can provide insights into the morphology of the lymphocytes, which can help differentiate between reactive and clonal processes.

If the diagnosis remains unclear after the initial workup, flow cytometry is often the next step. Flow cytometry can evaluate the immunophenotype of the lymphocytes, which can help narrow down the differential diagnosis. Common patterns seen in flow cytometry include:

- CLL: CD5+, CD23+, CD20 (dim), CD10-, cyclin D1-, weak sIg, FMC7-
- MCL: CD5+, CD23-, CD10-, CD20+, sIg+, cyclin D1+, FMC7+  
- FL: CD5-, CD10+, CD20+, sIg+, BCL2+, BCL6+
- MZL: CD5-, CD10-, CD20+, sIg+, cyclin D1-
- HCL: CD5-, CD10-, CD20+, sIg+, CD11c+, CD25+, CD103+
- T-LGL: CD3+, CD8+, CD16+, CD56+

If flow cytometry suggests a clonal process, additional testing such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), karyotype, and molecular analysis may be warranted to further characterize the underlying condition.

In cases where the diagnosis remains unclear or there is a high clinical suspicion of a severe pathology, a bone marrow biopsy may be performed.

In summary, the diagnostic approach to lymphocytosis involves a stepwise evaluation starting with a CBC, PBS, and potentially flow cytometry, followed by more advanced testing as indicated by the clinical presentation and initial findings.

## Treatment Options

Managing lymphocytosis requires addressing the underlying cause. For infections, such as viral illnesses, the focus is on supportive care and treating the infection itself. This can involve the use of antiviral medications or antibiotics, depending on the specific pathogen.

For lymphocytosis caused by chronic conditions or malignancies, the treatment approach is more targeted. In the case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), newer targeted therapies like Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, such as ibrutinib, have shown impressive responses and can help manage lymphocytosis. [1] Similarly, in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a combination of chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, and other novel agents are used to treat the underlying lymphoma and the associated lymphocytosis. [2]

For patients with monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), a condition characterized by a small clonal B-cell population, the standard approach is active surveillance with regular monitoring. Treatment is only initiated if the condition progresses to overt leukemia or lymphoma. [3]

In addition to medical interventions, nursing care plays a vital role in the management of lymphocytosis. Nurses can provide patient education on the importance of infection prevention, symptom monitoring, and adherence to prescribed treatments. They can also coordinate care with the healthcare team to ensure timely follow-up and appropriate adjustments to the treatment plan.

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination, isolation, and environmental management are key strategies to prevent or reduce the risk of lymphocytosis.

### Vaccination

- A major strategy to decrease infection risk is vaccination. However, vaccine response rates in patients with CLL are typically insufficient. Recent studies have demonstrated that individuals with clinical monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), the precursor to CLL, also have an increased risk of infection and thus could benefit from vaccines [1,2].

### Isolation

- Isolation can help prevent the spread of infections that may lead to lymphocytosis. This includes isolating patients with known infections and quarantining those who may have been exposed.

### Environmental Management

- Measures to improve the environment and minimize exposure to pathogens can also help prevent lymphocytosis. This could include:
  - Improving hygiene and sanitation practices
  - Ensuring proper ventilation and air filtration
  - Avoiding contact with sick individuals
  - Practicing good hand hygiene

By implementing these preventive strategies, the risk of lymphocytosis can be reduced. Vaccination, isolation, and environmental management work together to strengthen the immune system and reduce susceptibility to infections that can lead to elevated lymphocyte counts.

## Differential Diagnosis

Lymphocytosis can have a wide range of underlying causes, both reactive and malignant. Some key points in the differential diagnosis include:

[1] Reactive lymphocytosis: This is the most common cause of lymphocytosis, resulting from an immune response to an infection (viral, bacterial, parasitic) or inflammatory condition. The lymphocytes in reactive processes tend to be pleomorphic, with a range of sizes and shapes. Examples include infectious mononucleosis, pertussis, and autoimmune disorders. [2]

[2] Monoclonal lymphoproliferative disorders: These include chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, and other non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The lymphocytes in these conditions are typically monomorphic in appearance. [2,4]

[3] Congenital/inherited lymphocytosis: This is a rare cause of persistent lymphocytosis, often due to genetic mutations like CARD11 that lead to increased lymphocyte proliferation. [8]

[4] Lymphocytosis secondary to asplenia or stress: Conditions like severe illness, trauma, or post-splenectomy can also result in transient lymphocytosis. [10]

Overall, the key is to distinguish reactive from malignant causes based on the morphology and immunophenotype of the lymphocytes, along with the clinical context. Flow cytometry is often needed to assess for clonality and help narrow the differential diagnosis. [2,4]
