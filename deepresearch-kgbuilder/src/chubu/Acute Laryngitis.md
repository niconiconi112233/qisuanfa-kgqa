## Disease Overview

Acute laryngitis is the inflammation of the voice box, leading to hoarseness or loss of voice. It can be caused by viral or bacterial infections, vocal strain, environmental irritants, or autoimmune disorders. [1]

Acute laryngitis is a common medical condition that typically lasts less than 2 weeks. The most common cause is a viral upper respiratory infection, such as a cold or flu. Bacterial infections, vocal strain, and exposure to irritants like smoke or acid reflux can also lead to acute laryngitis. [2,3]

Symptoms of acute laryngitis include hoarseness, voice loss, sore throat, and dry cough. The diagnosis is usually made based on the patient's symptoms and a physical exam. Treatment focuses on resting the voice, staying hydrated, and addressing the underlying cause, whether it's an infection or irritation. Antibiotics are generally not needed unless there is a bacterial superinfection. [1,2]

While acute laryngitis is usually not serious, it can become chronic if the underlying cause is not addressed. Persistent hoarseness or symptoms lasting more than 2 weeks warrant medical evaluation. [2]

## Common Pathogens

Dogs and cats can develop laryngitis due to a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens. Some of the most common causes include:

[1] Infectious tracheobronchitis (kennel cough) in dogs, which is typically caused by a combination of viruses like canine parainfluenza virus and bacteria like Bordetella bronchiseptica [1]. These pathogens can lead to inflammation and swelling of the laryngeal mucosa.

[2] Canine distemper virus, which can also cause laryngeal inflammation as part of a systemic viral infection in dogs [1]. 

[3] Feline upper respiratory infections, including infectious rhinotracheitis (caused by feline herpesvirus) and calicivirus, which can both lead to laryngeal edema and inflammation in cats [2,7].

[4] Bacterial infections like Fusobacterium necrophorum and Trueperella pyogenes, which can cause a suppurative laryngeal chondropathy (inflammation of the laryngeal cartilage) in ruminants like sheep and cattle [2].

[5] Influenza A virus, which can lead to laryngitis in pigs [2].

In addition to these infectious causes, laryngitis may also develop secondary to irritation, trauma, or underlying conditions like allergies, heart disease, or cancer [2,4,6]. Proper diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition is essential for managing laryngitis in companion animals.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Laryngitis in dogs and cats typically presents with a range of clinical symptoms and signs. A cough is often the first noticeable sign, described as harsh, dry, and short at first, but becoming soft and moist over time and potentially very painful [1,2,3]. The cough may be induced by pressure on the larynx, exposure to irritants, swallowing, or attempts to administer medications [1,2,3]. 

Dogs and cats with laryngitis may also exhibit changes to their vocalizations, with the bark or meow sounding different or hoarse [1,2,3]. Difficulty breathing and stridor (high-pitched wheezing) can occur, especially with increased respiratory effort or exertion [1,2,3]. Affected animals may also show signs of discomfort such as holding their head lowered, keeping their mouth open, and difficulty swallowing [1,2,3]. 

In severe cases, fluid buildup and swelling of the larynx can develop rapidly, leading to marked respiratory distress, cyanosis (bluish mucous membranes), increased pulse, and elevated body temperature [1,2,3]. Untreated, this can ultimately result in collapse and asphyxiation [1,2,3]. Predisposing factors like brachycephalic conformation, obesity, and pre-existing laryngeal paralysis can exacerbate laryngeal inflammation and edema [1,2,3].

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosing acute laryngitis typically involves a clinical evaluation, as the condition is often readily identifiable based on the patient's presenting symptoms. [1] No specific laboratory testing is usually required, though a culture may be performed if there is oropharyngeal or vocal fold exudate to rule out a bacterial infection. [6]

The primary diagnostic tool is direct or indirect laryngoscopy, which allows the clinician to visually inspect the larynx. [1][6] This can reveal characteristic findings such as erythema, edema, and irregularities of the vocal folds. Laryngoscopy is recommended for symptoms lasting longer than 3 weeks or if a more serious underlying condition is suspected. [5] 

Stroboscopic examination of the vocal folds may also be performed, which can identify specific patterns of inflammation and edema that are indicative of acute laryngitis. [6] This includes reduced mucosal wave propagation and aperiodicity of vocal fold vibration.

Overall, the diagnosis of acute laryngitis is primarily clinical, focusing on the patient's history and presenting symptoms. Laryngoscopy is used to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of hoarseness and voice changes. Further imaging or laboratory testing is typically not required unless the clinical presentation is atypical or a more serious condition is suspected.

## Treatment Options

Acute laryngitis is often a mild, self-limiting condition that can be managed through various treatment approaches. The main goals are to reduce inflammation, soothe the vocal cords, and allow the larynx to heal.

[1] Rest the voice. Avoid excessive talking or straining the voice as much as possible to allow the vocal cords to recover. Whispering should also be avoided as it can further irritate the larynx.

[2] Hydrate and add moisture. Drink plenty of fluids, especially warm liquids like tea, to keep the throat moist. Use a humidifier to add moisture to the air and soothe the irritated larynx.

[3] Try over-the-counter medications. Pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help reduce inflammation and discomfort. Cough suppressants may also provide relief.

[4] Manage acid reflux. If the laryngitis is related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), antacid medications can help reduce irritation from stomach acid.

[5] Avoid irritants. Steer clear of smoke, dust, and other airborne irritants that could further aggravate the larynx.

[6] Use natural remedies. Some people find relief from herbal teas, honey, and other natural treatments. However, the effectiveness of these approaches is not conclusively proven.

In cases of suspected bacterial infection or persistent symptoms, a healthcare provider may prescribe antibiotics or corticosteroids to address the underlying cause and reduce inflammation. However, these medications are not routinely recommended for most cases of acute laryngitis.

The key is to provide supportive care and allow the larynx to heal on its own in most situations. With proper management, acute laryngitis typically resolves within 1-2 weeks. Seeking medical attention is recommended if symptoms persist or worsen.

## Preventive Measures

To prevent acute laryngitis, there are several key strategies to consider:

[1] Stay hydrated by drinking at least 8 glasses of water daily and avoiding dehydrating beverages like alcohol and caffeine.[2] Practice good vocal hygiene, including moderating volume and pitch, taking regular voice breaks, and warming up your voice with gentle exercises before extended use.[3] Steer clear of irritants like smoke, dust, and harsh chemicals that can inflame the larynx.[4] Manage stress and get adequate rest to support vocal health, as these factors can also contribute to laryngitis.[5]

Here is the report section on the differential diagnosis for acute laryngitis:

## Differential Diagnosis

Acute laryngitis can have several potential causes that present with similar symptoms. The key differential diagnoses include:

Viral infection: The majority of acute laryngitis cases are caused by common respiratory viruses like rhinovirus, influenza, or parainfluenza [1]. These viral infections lead to inflammation and swelling of the larynx.

Bacterial infection: While less common, acute laryngitis can also be caused by bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Staphylococcus aureus [1]. Bacterial laryngitis is more likely to present with high fever and a more toxic appearance.

Gastroesophageal reflux: Irritation from stomach acid refluxing up into the larynx can trigger inflammation and laryngeal symptoms [1]. This is more likely to cause a chronic, rather than acute, laryngitis.

Vocal strain/overuse: Excessive or improper use of the voice can lead to inflammation and swelling of the vocal cords, resulting in laryngeal symptoms [1].

Toxic inhalation: Exposure to irritants like smoke, chemicals, or toxins can directly damage the laryngeal mucosa and cause acute laryngitis [1].

Allergic reaction: Acute laryngeal edema can occur as part of a generalized allergic reaction, which should be considered in the differential diagnosis [1].

Foreign body aspiration: A foreign object lodged in the larynx can cause acute inflammation and symptoms mimicking laryngitis [1].

Prompt recognition of the underlying cause is important, as some conditions like epiglottitis or tracheitis require urgent airway management, while others like viral laryngitis can often be managed conservatively.
