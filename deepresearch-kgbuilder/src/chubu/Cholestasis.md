## Disease Overview

Cholestasis is a condition where the flow of bile from the liver to the duodenum is impaired. There are two basic distinctions:

[1] Obstructive type of cholestasis, where there is a mechanical blockage in the duct system that can occur from a gallstone or malignancy. 

[2] Metabolic type of cholestasis, in which there are disturbances in bile formation that can occur because of genetic defects.

Cholestasis can affect people of all ages, but children and adolescents are more susceptible due to the immaturity of the liver. There is no significant difference in prevalence between males and females, though females may be at slightly higher risk for certain causes like intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.

The symptoms of cholestasis include jaundice, pruritus (itching), fatigue, malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins, and skin lesions like xanthomas. The underlying cause determines the specific symptoms and severity.

### Causes

#### Extrahepatic Cholestasis
- Bile duct tumors
- Cysts affecting the bile duct 
- Narrowing of the bile duct (strictures)
- Stones in the common bile duct
- Pancreatitis
- Pancreatic tumor or pseudocyst
- Pressure on the bile ducts due to a nearby mass or tumor
- Primary sclerosing cholangitis

#### Intrahepatic Cholestasis
- Acute hepatitis 
- Alcohol-related liver disease
- Primary biliary cholangitis with inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts
- Cirrhosis due to viral hepatitis B or C
- Certain drugs (e.g. amoxicillin/clavulanate, chlorpromazine, azathioprine, oral contraceptives)
- Hormonal effects on bile flow during pregnancy (intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy)
- Cancer that has spread to the liver

### Diagnosis
Diagnosis involves a combination of blood tests, imaging studies, and sometimes liver biopsy. Key findings include:

- Elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and sometimes transaminases
- Abdominal ultrasound or MRCP to evaluate the bile ducts
- Liver biopsy in cases of suspected intrahepatic cholestasis

### Treatment
Treatment depends on the underlying cause:

- For obstructive causes, the focus is on biliary decompression through endoscopic or surgical intervention.
- For intrahepatic causes, treatment involves managing the underlying condition and symptoms, such as using medications to control pruritus.
- Liver transplantation may be necessary in severe, end-stage cases.

## Common Pathogens

Viral and bacterial infections can cause cholestasis through several mechanisms. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections are known to induce intrahepatic cholestasis, often presenting with a mononucleosis-like illness.[1] CMV infection can also lead to obstructive biliary disease and neonatal giant cell hepatitis with cholestasis, particularly in immunocompromised patients.[2]

Bacterial infections are another common cause of cholestasis. Sepsis and severe bacterial infections can disrupt bile elimination at the hepatocyte level, leading to cholestasis.[3] Specific bacterial pathogens like Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus are common culprits.[4] Zoonotic infections such as brucellosis and leptospirosis can also induce cholestasis through granulomatous liver inflammation.[5,6] 

In addition, mycobacterial infections like tuberculosis and disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex can lead to cholestasis, often through extrahepatic biliary obstruction from lymphadenopathy.[7,8] Fungal infections, including candidiasis, cryptococcosis, coccidioidomycosis, and histoplasmosis, can also infiltrate the liver and cause cholestasis in immunocompromised patients.[9,10]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

The clinical presentation of cholestasis in companion animals can vary depending on the underlying cause, but some common symptoms and signs include:

Jaundice: One of the most noticeable signs of cholestasis is jaundice, a yellowish discoloration of the skin, mucous membranes, and sclera (whites of the eyes) due to the accumulation of bilirubin in the body. [1] This is a result of the impaired bile flow and excretion.

Vomiting and abdominal pain: When there is a complete obstruction of the bile ducts, the backup of bile can cause abdominal discomfort and vomiting. [1]

Diarrhea: Decreased bile secretion into the intestines can lead to poor digestion and absorption of fats, resulting in diarrhea. [1]

Ascites: Fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity, known as ascites, can occur secondary to portal hypertension from the cholestasis. [1]

Pale or acholic (clay-colored) feces: In cases of complete bile duct obstruction, the lack of bile reaching the intestines can cause the feces to appear pale or clay-colored. [1]

Fever and acute abdomen: If the cholestasis leads to gallbladder rupture and bile peritonitis, the patient may develop fever, acute abdominal pain, and signs of sepsis. [1]

It is important to note that the clinical signs may not always be overt, especially in the early stages of cholestasis. Routine bloodwork abnormalities, such as elevated liver enzymes, may be the first indication of an underlying hepatobiliary problem. [2,3]

## Diagnostic Methods

The diagnosis of cholestasis involves a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory testing, and imaging techniques.

Clinical presentation is characterized by fatigue, pruritus, jaundice, dark urine, and pale/fatty stools. [1] Laboratory tests show elevated serum levels of bilirubin (predominantly direct/conjugated bilirubin), alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). [1,2] 

Abdominal ultrasound is the initial imaging modality of choice to evaluate cholestasis. It can identify dilated bile ducts indicative of extrahepatic obstruction. [3] However, ultrasound has limited sensitivity in detecting some causes of intrahepatic cholestasis. 

More advanced imaging techniques like magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may be used to further characterize the biliary anatomy and identify the underlying etiology. MRCP is a non-invasive technique that can visualize the entire biliary tree with high accuracy, while ERCP provides direct visualization and sampling of the bile ducts. [4,5]

In some cases, liver biopsy may be necessary to establish the diagnosis, particularly when the cause of cholestasis remains unclear after initial evaluation. Biopsy can help differentiate intrahepatic from extrahepatic causes and provide information on disease stage and severity. [6]

In summary, the diagnostic approach to cholestasis involves a stepwise evaluation using clinical assessment, laboratory tests, and imaging modalities to identify the underlying etiology and guide appropriate management.

## Treatment Options

Cholestasis is a condition characterized by the slowing or stalling of bile flow, which can have various underlying causes. The treatment approach depends on the specific cause and aims to restore normal bile flow and address any associated symptoms or complications.

[1] Medications are often used as the first-line treatment for cholestasis. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the most commonly used drug, as it can help increase bile flow and reduce bile acid levels. [2] However, UDCA is not effective in treating the pruritus (itching) associated with cholestasis. For this symptom, other medications may be used, such as the antibiotic rifampicin, the opioid antagonist naltrexone, or the antidepressant sertraline. [2]

[3] In cases where a physical obstruction is causing the cholestasis, such as a gallstone or tumor, surgical interventions may be necessary. Procedures like endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) can be used to remove the obstruction and restore bile flow. [3]

[4] Lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes, can also play an important role in managing cholestasis. Patients may be advised to follow a low-fat diet to reduce the strain on the biliary system. [3] Supplementation of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) may also be necessary to address any nutritional deficiencies resulting from impaired bile flow. [3]

[5] In severe or refractory cases of cholestasis, liver transplantation may be considered as a last resort treatment option. This is typically reserved for patients with advanced liver disease or failure due to the underlying condition causing the cholestasis.

## Preventive Measures

Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and taking proactive steps can help prevent or manage cholestasis. Key preventive measures include:

[1] Vaccination and Infection Control: Vaccination against hepatitis viruses reduces the risk of viral-induced cholestasis. Proper hygiene and infection control measures are important to avoid exposure to infectious agents that can lead to cholestasis.

[2] Healthy Lifestyle: Maintaining a balanced diet rich in fiber and low in fats, staying hydrated, and engaging in regular exercise can help promote overall liver health and prevent conditions that may contribute to cholestasis, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

[3] Medication Management: Avoiding medications that are known to cause cholestasis or discussing alternative options with a healthcare provider is crucial. Monitoring and managing any pre-existing liver conditions can also help prevent the development of cholestasis.

[4] Stress Management: Practicing stress-reducing techniques, such as meditation, yoga, or other relaxation methods, may help mitigate the impact of hormonal changes and inflammation that can contribute to cholestasis, particularly in the case of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.

[5] Genetic Screening: Individuals with a family history of cholestatic liver diseases may benefit from genetic testing to identify any predispositions and take appropriate preventive measures.

By implementing these preventive strategies, individuals can reduce their risk of developing cholestasis and help maintain optimal liver function.

## Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for cholestasis includes a wide range of conditions that can impair bile flow, both within the liver and in the bile ducts outside the liver. Some key points:

Intrahepatic cholestasis causes include:
- Drug-induced liver injury (e.g. from anabolic steroids, amoxicillin/clavulanate)
- Acute viral hepatitis 
- Chronic liver diseases like primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis
- Pregnancy-related cholestasis
- Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis
- Sepsis

Extrahepatic cholestasis causes include:
- Biliary stones or strictures
- Pancreatic or bile duct cancers
- Pancreatitis
- Biliary atresia

The key distinction is whether the cholestasis is due to an intrahepatic process affecting liver cells/ducts or an extrahepatic obstruction of the bile ducts. This is often determined through imaging tests like ultrasound and MRCP.

Overall, the differential is broad and careful history, physical exam, laboratory tests, and imaging are needed to identify the underlying cause in each case of cholestasis. Distinguishing intrahepatic from extrahepatic causes is an important first step in the diagnostic workup.
