## Disease Overview

Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a highly contagious virus that causes respiratory infections and oral disease in cats. It is one of the major causes of upper respiratory infections, commonly referred to as "cat flu", in the feline population.[1] FCV belongs to the Caliciviridae family of viruses, which can infect a wide range of animals including rabbits, livestock, and even humans through related viruses like norovirus.[2] 

The virus is widespread and can spread easily between cats through direct contact, airborne transmission, and contaminated surfaces. Cats are at higher risk of exposure in environments with multiple cats like shelters, catteries, and multi-cat households.[1] FCV is known to mutate readily, leading to the development of new strains that may not be fully covered by existing vaccines. While most FCV infections cause only mild symptoms, rare mutant strains can lead to severe, life-threatening disease with complications like pneumonia, hepatitis, and bleeding.[3]

## Common Pathogens

Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a highly contagious virus that causes a range of respiratory and oral diseases in cats [1]. It is a common viral pathogen that can lead to mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections and even virulent systemic disease in some cases [1]. 

In addition to FCV, several other pathogens can also cause respiratory and oral infections in cats:

- Feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1): Another common viral cause of upper respiratory tract disease and oral inflammation in cats [2].

- Mycoplasma felis: A bacterial species that can contribute to respiratory and oral disease in cats, often in conjunction with viral infections [2].

- Chlamydia felis: A bacterial pathogen that can cause conjunctivitis and upper respiratory tract infections in cats [2]. 

- Bordetella bronchiseptica: A bacterium that can lead to tracheobronchitis and pneumonia in cats, sometimes in combination with viral infections [2].

Many of these pathogens, including FCV, can be spread through direct contact with infected cats or indirectly via contaminated environments, food/water bowls, and human handling [1,2]. Co-infections with multiple organisms are common and can lead to more severe clinical signs [2].

Vaccination, strict hygiene, and isolation of infected cats are important in preventing and controlling outbreaks of these feline respiratory and oral diseases [1].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Feline calicivirus infection can cause a range of clinical symptoms in cats, from mild to severe. The most common signs include:

[1] Sneezing, nasal discharge, and conjunctivitis (eye inflammation). These upper respiratory symptoms often resemble a cat "cold".

[2] Ulcers on the tongue, lips, gums, or hard palate, which can lead to drooling and poor appetite. 

[3] Fever, lethargy, and dehydration.

In more severe cases, cats may also develop:

[4] Pneumonia, with coughing and difficulty breathing.

[5] Joint inflammation, causing limping or swelling.

[6] Severe systemic disease, with swelling in the face/legs, skin wounds, bloody nose/stool, and multi-organ failure. This virulent form, called FCV-associated virulent systemic disease (FCV-VSD), has a high mortality rate.

The severity of symptoms can vary depending on the specific strain of calicivirus and the cat's age and immune status. Younger kittens and older cats tend to experience more severe disease. Even vaccinated cats can become infected, though typically with milder symptoms compared to unvaccinated animals.

## Diagnostic Methods

To confirm feline calicivirus infection, veterinarians typically use a combination of clinical signs, laboratory testing, and other diagnostic techniques.

The first step is to evaluate the cat's clinical presentation. Feline calicivirus can cause a range of upper respiratory symptoms, including sneezing, nasal discharge, conjunctivitis, and oral ulcers [1]. The veterinarian will assess these signs and look for any other potential underlying conditions.

For definitive diagnosis, laboratory testing is often required. The most common diagnostic test is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, which can detect the genetic material of the calicivirus [2,3]. This test can be performed on samples collected from the cat's eyes, nose, or mouth. PCR testing is considered more sensitive and accurate than other methods, such as virus isolation or antibody titers [4].

In some cases, the veterinarian may also recommend additional testing, such as:

- Complete blood count and chemistry panel to evaluate the cat's overall health status [2]
- Chest radiographs to check for any lung involvement, such as pneumonia [2]
- Sedation and oral examination to inspect for lesions in the mouth and throat [2]

Taken together, the clinical signs, PCR test results, and any supplementary diagnostic findings allow the veterinarian to confirm a diagnosis of feline calicivirus infection.

## Treatment Options

Feline calicivirus has no direct cure, but supportive care and management of symptoms are essential for recovery. The main treatment approaches include:

[1] Supportive care:
- Keep the cat in a warm, quiet environment to reduce stress
- Provide good nutrition by offering strongly scented, soft foods and potentially syringe feeding if the cat is not eating
- Use warm, damp cloths to clean discharge from the eyes and nose
- Use a vaporizer or steam therapy to help reduce nasal congestion

[2] Medications:
- Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat secondary bacterial infections
- Anti-inflammatory drugs can help reduce fever and pain
- Appetite stimulants may be given if the cat is not eating
- Ophthalmic medications can treat eye inflammation and ulcers

[3] Fluids and nutrition:
- Intravenous or subcutaneous fluids may be needed to prevent dehydration
- Feeding tubes may be required if the cat is unable to eat due to oral ulcers

[4] Isolation and disinfection:
- Infected cats should be isolated from other pets to prevent spread of the virus
- Thorough cleaning and disinfection of the environment is crucial to kill the virus

[5] Vaccination:
- While the calicivirus vaccine does not prevent infection, it can help reduce the severity of illness in vaccinated cats

The key is providing supportive care to keep the cat comfortable while its immune system fights the virus. Most cats recover within 7-10 days with proper treatment, though some may become chronic carriers of the virus.

## Preventive Measures

Preventing feline calicivirus (FCV) infection requires a multi-pronged approach. Vaccination is crucial, as it can greatly reduce the severity of symptoms if a cat is exposed. Kittens should receive a series of FCV vaccines starting as early as 6-8 weeks of age, with boosters every 3-4 weeks until 16-20 weeks old [1]. Adult cats should then receive a booster shot one year later, followed by boosters every 3 years [1].

In addition to vaccination, maintaining a clean environment is key. FCV can persist in the environment for up to a month, so regular disinfection of surfaces, food/water bowls, and litter boxes is crucial [2]. Effective disinfectants include sodium hypochlorite (diluted bleach), potassium peroxymonosulfate, chlorine dioxide, and commercial products approved for calicivirus inactivation [2].

Finally, isolating infected cats can help prevent the spread of FCV. Cats that test positive or display symptoms should be kept separate from healthy cats until they recover [1]. Good hygiene practices, such as washing hands after handling infected cats, also reduce the risk of transmission [1].

## Differential Diagnosis

Feline calicivirus infection can have similar symptoms to other common feline respiratory diseases, so a differential diagnosis is important. The key differential diagnoses include:

- Feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) infection - Another common cause of upper respiratory infections in cats, with symptoms like sneezing, nasal/ocular discharge, and oral ulcers.

- Chlamydia felis infection - Can cause conjunctivitis, nasal discharge, and pneumonia in cats.

- Bordetella bronchiseptica infection - Bacterial infection that can lead to rhinitis, tracheitis, and bronchopneumonia. 

- Mycoplasma spp. infection - Can cause upper respiratory symptoms and pneumonia.

- Other viral infections like feline panleukopenia virus (feline distemper) - Can have similar systemic symptoms.

- Bacterial infections like streptococcal or staphylococcal infections - Can also cause oral/respiratory signs.

- Fungal infections like cryptococcosis or aspergillosis - Can present with nasal discharge, sneezing, and other respiratory symptoms.

The type of symptoms, exposure history, and diagnostic test results like PCR or virus isolation are all important in distinguishing feline calicivirus from these other potential causes of respiratory disease in cats. Careful clinical evaluation is key to reaching the correct differential diagnosis.
