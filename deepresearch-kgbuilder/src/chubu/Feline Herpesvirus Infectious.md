Here is a 186-word section on the overview of feline herpesvirus:

## Feline Herpesvirus Overview

Feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) is a highly contagious viral infection that causes upper respiratory tract disease in cats. It is the most common cause of respiratory infections in cats, responsible for around half of all feline respiratory diseases. 

FHV-1 is a member of the Herpesviridae family and Varicellovirus genus. It is closely related to herpesviruses that infect other animals like dogs and seals. While it can infect wild cats, the domestic cat is the main host.

Cats become infected through direct contact with the virus in saliva, nasal discharge, or eye secretions of infected cats. The virus replicates in the upper respiratory tract and can spread to the eyes and skin. After the initial infection, FHV-1 establishes lifelong latency in the nervous system. Reactivation of the latent virus can occur during times of stress, leading to recurrent disease and virus shedding.

Around 80% of cats that have been infected with FHV-1 become lifelong carriers of the virus. While vaccinations can help reduce disease severity, they do not prevent infection or eliminate latent virus.

## Pathogenesis and Clinical Presentation

Feline herpesvirus infection is caused by the feline herpesvirus type-1 (FHV-1), which primarily affects the upper respiratory tract and eyes of cats. [1] The virus is highly contagious and can be transmitted through direct contact with infected secretions or sharing of contaminated objects like food/water bowls and litter boxes. [1] 

Within 24 hours of exposure, infected cats can begin shedding the virus and transmitting it to other cats. [6] After the initial infection, the virus becomes latent in the trigeminal ganglia but can reactivate during times of stress or illness, leading to recurrent clinical signs. [1]

Common clinical signs of FHV-1 infection include sneezing, nasal discharge, conjunctivitis, corneal ulceration, fever, lethargy, and anorexia. [1,6] The severity of illness can vary, with younger, immunocompromised, or unvaccinated cats being more susceptible to severe disease. [6] Chronic damage to the nasal turbinates and corneal scarring can occur with recurrent infections. [1]

In summary, feline herpesvirus is a highly contagious virus that causes upper respiratory and ocular disease in cats. The virus can become latent but reactivate during stressful periods, leading to recurrent clinical signs. Kittens, senior cats, and those with other underlying conditions are at greatest risk for severe illness. [1,6]

## Diagnosis and Testing

Diagnosing feline herpesvirus infection involves a combination of clinical evaluation, symptom assessment, and specialized laboratory tests. While presumptive diagnosis based on characteristic signs like conjunctivitis, nasal discharge, and corneal ulcers is common, definitive confirmation can be challenging. [1]

One of the primary diagnostic methods is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, which can detect the presence of feline herpesvirus DNA in samples from the eyes, nose, or mouth. PCR is a highly sensitive technique that can provide results within hours. However, it has limitations - it cannot differentiate between active infections and latent shedding, and false negatives are possible. [1,2]

Cytology, where cells are examined under a microscope, can also be useful in assessing secondary bacterial infections that may accompany feline herpesvirus. However, cytology alone does not confirm the presence of the virus. [1]

Blood tests may show non-specific indicators of infection, such as elevated white blood cell counts, but these are not definitive for feline herpesvirus diagnosis. [1] 

Ultimately, a combination of clinical signs, patient history, and specialized testing is often required to diagnose feline herpesvirus infection. Veterinarians must also be aware of the limitations of these diagnostic methods and rule out other potential causes of similar symptoms. [1,2]

## Treatment and Management

### Antiviral Medications

Antiviral medications play a crucial role in managing feline herpes. Common choices include Famciclovir and Acyclovir. Famciclovir is a prodrug that is effectively converted to penciclovir, the active antiviral metabolite. Studies show Famciclovir significantly reduces clinical symptoms and viral shedding in affected cats. [1]

Acyclovir is also available as a topical ophthalmic ointment and has been shown to help resolve clinical signs when applied 5 times daily. However, systemic administration of acyclovir can be toxic to cats. [1]

### Supportive Care

Supportive care is essential for helping cats recover from feline herpes outbreaks. This includes:

- Maintaining hydration and nutrition, as affected cats may have reduced appetite
- Using steam therapy to help clear nasal congestion
- Gently cleaning around the eyes and nose to remove discharge
- Providing a quiet, low-stress environment for the cat to rest

Creating a comfortable, supportive environment can help boost the cat's immune system and aid in recovery. [2]

### Prevention Strategies

The best way to prevent feline herpes is through vaccination. Kittens should receive a series of FHV-1 vaccines starting at 6-8 weeks of age, with booster shots every 3-4 weeks until 16-20 weeks old. Adult cats should also receive regular FHV-1 booster vaccines. [2]

Additionally, good hygiene practices are crucial to limit transmission, such as:

- Disinfecting food and water bowls, litter boxes, and other shared surfaces
- Isolating any infected cats to prevent spread to other pets
- Minimizing stress, as this can reactivate latent FHV-1 infections

With proper treatment and prevention, most cats with feline herpes can live happy, healthy lives.

## Conclusion

Feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) is a highly contagious viral infection that affects the upper respiratory tract and eyes of domestic cats. The virus can cause a range of severe clinical signs, including sneezing, nasal discharge, conjunctivitis, and corneal ulceration. Diagnosis often requires a combination of clinical assessment and specialized testing, such as PCR. 

Effective management of FHV-1 involves antiviral medications like Famciclovir, as well as supportive care to maintain hydration and nutrition. Vaccination is the best prevention strategy, with kittens receiving a series of FHV-1 shots and adult cats receiving regular boosters. Good hygiene practices, such as disinfecting shared surfaces, are also crucial to limit transmission.

With proper treatment and proactive prevention, most cats with feline herpes can recover and live healthy lives, though the virus remains latent and may reactivate during times of stress. Veterinarians play a key role in guiding owners through the diagnosis, management, and long-term care of this common feline viral infection.
