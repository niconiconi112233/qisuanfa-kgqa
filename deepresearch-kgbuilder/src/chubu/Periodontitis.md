## Introduction

Periodontal disease is a major health concern for companion animals, with the majority of dogs and cats affected by some degree of the condition. Periodontal disease is an inflammatory condition affecting the tissues that support the teeth, and if left untreated, can lead to severe complications.

Studies show that up to 70% of cats and 80% of dogs over the age of 3 have some level of periodontal disease [1]. The prevalence increases with age, and smaller breed dogs are at higher risk. Periodontal disease has far-reaching consequences beyond just dental problems, as the infection and inflammation can impact the overall health of the animal.

## Pathogenesis

Periodontal disease begins with the buildup of plaque, a sticky film of bacteria, food particles, and saliva on the tooth surface. If not removed, this plaque can harden into tartar, leading to gum inflammation (gingivitis). Without intervention, the disease progresses, affecting the deeper periodontal structures like the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone, causing attachment loss and tooth mobility (periodontitis) [2].

The bacteria in plaque and tartar can stimulate an inflammatory response from the host, which in turn damages the periodontal tissues. Certain bacterial species are associated with more severe periodontal disease, and there appears to be a genetic component as well [3,4].

## Clinical Findings

The hallmark clinical signs of periodontal disease include bad breath (halitosis), visible plaque and calculus, red and swollen gums, gingival recession, periodontal pockets, tooth mobility, and eventually tooth loss [5]. Careful probing and dental radiography are needed to fully assess the extent of attachment loss and bone destruction.

Periodontal disease can also lead to local complications like oronasal fistulas, endodontic lesions, pathologic fractures, and osteomyelitis [9]. These advanced stages of disease can be extremely painful for the animal.

## Systemic Consequences

The systemic impact of periodontal disease is now well-recognized. The bacteria and inflammatory mediators from the diseased oral cavity can enter the bloodstream and affect distant organs [10]. Periodontal disease has been associated with increased risks of:

- Kidney disease [2,3,4]
- Liver disease 
- Heart disease (endocarditis) [35]
- Diabetes complications [44,45]
- Certain cancers [46-48]
- Early mortality [49-52]

These connections underscore the importance of maintaining good oral health in pets, as it is directly linked to their overall well-being and longevity.

## Prevention and Treatment

Successful prevention and management of periodontal disease requires a multi-pronged approach involving both the veterinarian and the pet owner [53,54].

Professional dental cleanings under general anesthesia are essential to remove plaque and tartar build-up. This allows the veterinarian to fully assess disease severity and perform necessary procedures like root scaling, curettage, extractions, and periodontal surgery.

At-home dental care is also crucial, including daily tooth brushing with pet-safe toothpaste and the use of dental-friendly foods, treats, and products approved by the Veterinary Oral Health Council.

By prioritizing their pets' oral health through regular veterinary care and diligent home hygiene, owners can help prevent the devastating local and systemic consequences of periodontal disease. This proactive approach is key to maintaining the overall health and longevity of companion animals.

## Pathogenesis

Periodontitis is a severe gum infection that can lead to tooth loss, bone loss, and other serious health complications. The development of periodontitis involves a complex interplay between the oral microbiome and the host immune response.

The primary etiological agent for the initiation and progression of periodontal disease is the dental plaque biofilm, which is an organized aggregation of microorganisms residing within a complex intercellular matrix. [1][2]

The non-specific plaque hypothesis was the first attempt to explain the role of the dental biofilm in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. However, newer research has revealed a more complicated picture, with the microbiological changes associated with disease representing whole-scale alterations to the overall microbial population structure and the functional properties of the entire community. [1][2]

In a healthy state, there is a delicate balance between the local immune response and the oral microbiota. Immune surveillance and tolerance of the local microbiota are achieved without a severe inflammatory response. [1][3]

However, the colonization of "keystone" pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, can disrupt this homeostasis and elevate the pathogenicity of the entire microbial community. This leads to an over-activation of the host immune response, which results in the infiltration of immune cells, activation of osteoclastic activity, and eventual destruction of soft and hard periodontal tissues. [1][3]

The pathological host immune response against the dysbiotic oral microbiome can be categorized into three stages:

1. The first wave involves direct interactions between the microbiome and host cells, including periodontal tissue cells and innate immune cells. This leads to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1, IL-6, and TNF. [1]

2. The second stage involves the secretion of cytokines that drive the differentiation of specific T cell subsets, such as Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cells. These cytokines and cell subsets form a complex and integrated host immune response network against the pathogenic bacteria. [1]

3. The cytokines and immune cells in the final stage can act as positive feedback factors or direct effectors, ultimately leading to tissue destruction through mechanisms like enhanced osteoclastic activity. [1]

The complex cytokine network and interplay between the oral microbiome and host immune response are central to the pathogenesis of periodontitis. Disruption of this delicate balance leads to the inflammation and tissue destruction characteristic of this disease.

## Clinical Presentation

Gingivitis, the earliest stage of periodontal disease, is characterized by the following symptoms:

- Redness and swelling of the gums [1,2] 
- Gums that bleed easily during brushing or flossing [1,2]
- Bad breath (halitosis) due to the buildup of bacteria [1,2]
- Slight gum recession, exposing more of the tooth surface [2]

As gingivitis progresses without treatment, it can develop into periodontitis. Early periodontitis is marked by:

- Increased gum recession and tooth sensitivity [2,3]
- Persistent bad breath despite good oral hygiene [2,3] 
- Formation of periodontal pockets between the teeth and gums [2,3]
- Occasional discomfort and minor tooth mobility [3]

Moderate periodontitis involves more significant damage, including:

- Increased tooth mobility due to bone loss [3,4]
- Visible signs of infection, such as pus [3,4]
- Deeper periodontal pockets that make plaque removal difficult [3,4]

Advanced periodontitis is the most severe stage, characterized by:

- Extensive gum recession and bone loss [5,6]
- Loose, unstable teeth that may eventually fall out [5,6]
- Abscess formation between the teeth and gums [5,6]

## Diagnostic Approach

The clinical examination, diagnostic tests, and imaging modalities used to evaluate and stage periodontal disease include:

### Clinical Examination
- Medical and dental history review
- Visual assessment of gingival color, contour, and texture
- Examination of soft tissues around teeth for presence/type of exudate
- Identification of plaque and calculus
- Measurement of probing depths, clinical attachment levels, gingival recession/hyperplasia
- Evaluation of furcation involvement
- Examination of teeth for mobility, caries, occlusal trauma

### Diagnostic Tests
- Radiographic assessment, including periapical and bite-wing radiographs
- Microbial assessment, genetic testing, and other laboratory tests

The clinical examination and radiographic assessment are used to measure parameters like probing depth, clinical attachment level, and bone loss to determine the stage and grade of periodontal disease. Additionally, the presence of bleeding on probing is a key indicator of current disease activity.

While traditional 2D radiography provides information on bone loss, it has limitations in fully assessing complex periodontal defects. Newer 3D imaging modalities like cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) can provide more comprehensive evaluation of the periodontal structures.

Overall, the diagnostic approach involves a thorough clinical examination, selective use of radiographic imaging, and potentially other diagnostic tests to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the patient's periodontal condition. This information is then used to determine the appropriate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment plan.

## Treatment Options

Periodontal disease can be treated through a variety of therapeutic interventions, including:

[1] Professional cleaning and scaling: Dentists and dental hygienists can perform deep cleanings to remove plaque and tartar buildup from above and below the gum line. This helps reduce bacterial infection and inflammation.[1]

[2] Antimicrobial treatments: Antiseptic mouthwashes containing chlorhexidine or antibiotics like minocycline, doxycycline, or metronidazole can be used to help control bacteria and promote healing.[1,2]

[3] Surgical procedures: For more advanced periodontal disease, dentists may perform surgical treatments like gingivectomy, gingival flap procedures, osseous surgery, or regenerative procedures to reduce pocket depth, reshape the gums and bone, and promote tissue regeneration.[3,4]

The appropriate treatment approach depends on the severity of the periodontal disease. Less invasive options like professional cleaning and antimicrobials may be sufficient for mild cases, while surgical interventions are often needed for moderate to advanced periodontitis to effectively manage the condition.

## Prevention Strategies

Maintaining good oral hygiene through daily brushing and flossing is the foundation for preventing periodontal disease. Brushing your teeth twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste and cleaning between your teeth daily using floss or other interdental cleaners can help remove plaque and prevent gingivitis from developing.[1] 

In addition to personal oral hygiene, professional preventive care is essential. Regular dental cleanings and checkups allow your dentist or dental hygienist to remove hardened plaque (tartar) and identify any early signs of gum disease.[1] Your dentist may also recommend using an antimicrobial mouthrinse or toothpaste containing antibacterial agents like essential oils or cetylpyridinium chloride to help control gingivitis.[2,3]

For individuals at higher risk of periodontal disease due to factors like smoking, diabetes, or poor oral hygiene, your dentist may provide more intensive preventive treatments. This could include more frequent professional cleanings, use of antimicrobial products, or other interventions to better manage your risk.[2,3]

Addressing lifestyle factors that contribute to periodontal disease, such as smoking cessation and maintaining good glycemic control for those with diabetes, is also important for prevention.[2,3] Overall, a combination of daily oral hygiene, regular professional care, and management of risk factors is key to preventing the development and progression of periodontal disease.
