## Disease Overview

Mediastinitis is an inflammation of the mediastinal region, which is the central compartment of the thoracic cavity between the lungs. It is a rare condition in dogs, but can be life-threatening in severe cases.[1] Mediastinitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection or a fungal infection, and can result from trauma, foreign body penetration of the esophagus, or other underlying conditions.[1,2] 

Symptoms of mediastinitis in dogs may include gagging, excessive drooling, difficulty swallowing, vomiting, lethargy, weight loss, fever, and respiratory distress.[1] Diagnosis often involves various diagnostic tests such as bloodwork, imaging, and endoscopy to identify the underlying cause.[1] 

Treatment depends on the severity and cause of the infection, but typically involves a combination of antibiotics, anti-fungal medication, fluid therapy, and potentially surgical intervention if an abscess or perforated organ is present.[1] Prognosis can vary depending on the extent of the infection, but with prompt and appropriate treatment, many dogs can recover from mediastinitis.[1]

## Common Pathogens

Mediastinitis can be caused by a variety of viral, bacterial, and other infectious agents:

Viral causes include influenza and other respiratory viruses [1]. However, viral mediastinitis is rare compared to bacterial causes.

The most common bacterial causes are [1,2]:
- Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, which account for 60-80% of cases
- Other gram-positive bacteria like Streptococcus species
- Gram-negative bacteria like Klebsiella, especially in patients with diabetes

Less frequent causes include fungal infections like histoplasmosis and tuberculosis [3,4]. These tend to cause a more chronic, granulomatous form of mediastinitis.

In summary, the key pathogens associated with mediastinitis are mainly bacterial, with Staphylococcus species being the most common causative agents. Viral and fungal causes are less frequent.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Acute mediastinitis, often a complication of chest surgery, typically presents with sudden and severe symptoms. Patients may experience [1]:

- Abrupt, severe chest pain
- Chills and fever
- Drainage from the surgical wound 
- Shortness of breath

Chronic mediastinitis, such as fibrosing mediastinitis, can have a more gradual onset. Patients may experience [1,2]:

- Chest pain
- Cough, potentially producing blood
- Shortness of breath
- Symptoms related to compression of mediastinal structures, like superior vena cava syndrome

Overall, mediastinitis should be suspected in patients with severe chest symptoms, especially if they have a history of recent chest surgery or other risk factors like esophageal perforation. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical, as mediastinitis can rapidly progress and become life-threatening.

## Diagnostic Methods

Mediastinitis is a serious condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. The key diagnostic tests and procedures used to evaluate and confirm mediastinitis include:

[1] Imaging studies: Computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest are the gold standard for diagnosing mediastinitis. CT scans can identify air in the mediastinum, fluid collections, and the extent of the infection. Chest X-rays may show mediastinal widening, but are less sensitive than CT. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is less suitable due to the presence of metallic devices in many patients and the challenges of scanning critically ill patients.

[2] Laboratory tests: Blood tests typically show leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein, and increased procalcitonin levels, indicating a severe infection. Blood cultures may identify the causative bacteria, allowing targeted antibiotic therapy. Cultures of any wound drainage should also be obtained.

[3] Physical examination and medical history: A thorough physical exam and review of the patient's medical, surgical, and travel history are crucial to assessing risk factors and identifying potential sources of the infection, such as recent procedures or underlying conditions.

[4] Needle aspiration: In some cases, a needle aspiration of the mediastinum may be performed to obtain a sample for culture and confirm the diagnosis.

Early diagnosis is essential, as delays in diagnosing mediastinitis can significantly increase morbidity and mortality. A high index of suspicion, combined with the appropriate diagnostic tests, is necessary to ensure prompt recognition and treatment of this life-threatening condition.

## Treatment Options

Mediastinitis can be a serious and life-threatening condition that requires prompt medical intervention. The treatment approach varies depending on whether the mediastinitis is acute or chronic.

### Acute Mediastinitis

Acute mediastinitis is often caused by complications from chest surgery, such as a median sternotomy, or by a perforation in the esophagus. Treatment typically involves:

- Antibiotics: Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics are given to treat the infection. The antibiotics may be adjusted based on culture results.
- Surgical debridement and drainage: Surgery is often needed to remove dead or infected tissue and drain any abscesses or fluid collections in the mediastinum. This may involve reopening the previous surgical incision.
- Delayed wound closure: The wound may be left open initially and closed later, often with the use of muscle flaps, once the infection is under control.

### Chronic Mediastinitis 

Chronic mediastinitis is usually caused by fungal infections or other granulomatous conditions. Treatment options include:

- Antifungal medications: Antifungal drugs like amphotericin B may be used to treat the underlying fungal infection.
- Surgical treatment: Surgery may be needed in some cases to relieve symptoms caused by compression of mediastinal structures, such as the superior vena cava or airways.

### Supportive Care

Regardless of the type of mediastinitis, supportive care measures are important, including:

- Nutrition support: Enteral or parenteral nutrition may be needed to support the patient during treatment.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: Close monitoring and management of the patient's blood pressure, heart function, and fluid balance.
- Respiratory support: Mechanical ventilation or other respiratory support may be required.

In summary, the treatment of mediastinitis involves a combination of antibiotics, surgical intervention, and supportive care measures tailored to the specific type and severity of the condition. Early recognition and prompt treatment are crucial to improve outcomes and reduce the risk of complications.

## Prevention Measures

Optimising preoperative glycaemic control is recommended in diabetic patients with high preoperative HbA1c levels (>6.5â€“7%) to reduce the risk of mediastinitis. [1,2] 

Patients should be encouraged to stop smoking at least 30 days before cardiac surgery. Smoking cessation has consistently been shown to reduce complications, including mediastinitis, in patients undergoing surgery. [3,4]

## Differential Diagnosis

Mediastinitis can present with non-specific symptoms, so it is important to consider other diseases and conditions that may cause similar symptoms. Some key differential diagnoses include:

[1] Mediastinal tumors, both benign and malignant, can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and coughing up blood, similar to mediastinitis. However, weight loss and anemia are more commonly seen in patients with malignant tumors.[7] Diagnostic imaging and biopsy can help differentiate mediastinal tumors from mediastinitis.

[2] Inflammatory and infectious conditions of the mediastinum, such as acute or chronic mediastinitis without accompanying fibrosis, can also cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and fever. Conditions like sarcoidosis, which can present with granulomas in the mediastinum, may be mistaken for the granulomatous form of fibrosing mediastinitis.[8,9] 

[3] Vascular disorders of the mediastinum, including thoracic aortic aneurysms and aortic dissections, can lead to chest pain and difficulty swallowing, similar to mediastinitis. However, the pain is often sudden and severe in vascular conditions, and patients may experience paralysis or dizziness, which are not common in mediastinitis.[10,11]

[4] Other miscellaneous conditions that can mimic mediastinitis include mediastinal cysts and lymphadenopathy.[12,13] Careful history, physical exam, and appropriate diagnostic imaging are essential to distinguish mediastinitis from these other disorders.
