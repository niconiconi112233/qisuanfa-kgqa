## Disease Overview

Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is a highly prevalent viral infection in domestic cats worldwide [1]. Most FCoV infections cause asymptomatic or mild gastrointestinal illness, with fecal shedding of the virus [2]. However, in a small percentage of infected cats, FCoV can mutate and develop into the more severe feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [3]. FIP is a fatal, systemic disease that occurs when the virus shifts from infecting intestinal cells to infecting immune cells, leading to widespread inflammation [4]. 

While FCoV is commonly found in cat populations, only 5-10% of infected cats actually develop FIP [1]. Factors like viral genetics, host immunity, age, breed, and environment all contribute to the risk of FIP development [5]. FIP typically affects younger cats under 1.5 years old, with over 50% of cases occurring in kittens under 7 months [6]. The disease presents in either a "wet" or "dry" form, with fluid accumulation or granuloma formation, respectively [3]. Diagnosis of FIP remains challenging, as there is no definitive test, and a combination of clinical signs, laboratory findings, and imaging is often required [6]. 

Recent advancements have led to the development of effective antiviral treatments for FIP, which were previously considered fatal [7]. However, prevention of the underlying FCoV infection remains difficult given its ubiquitous nature in cat populations. Strategies to limit FCoV transmission, such as environmental disinfection and cat housing management, may help reduce FIP risk [2].

## Common Pathogens

Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) is the predominant cause of feline coronaviral enteritis. FECV typically causes a subclinical or mild, transient intestinal infection in cats, with some cats continuing to shed the virus indefinitely [1,2]. However, mutation of FECV to a form that can infect macrophages leads to the development of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a highly fatal, multisystemic disease [1].

While FECV is highly prevalent worldwide in domestic cats, only 5-10% of FECV-infected cats go on to develop FIP [2,3]. Factors that increase the risk of FIP include stress, age, immunosuppressive infections, and genetic predisposition [4,5]. 

Canine coronavirus (CCV) can also infect cats and cause enteritis and diarrhea, as well as potentially lead to FIP in some cases [1]. However, CCV infection in cats is less common than FECV.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Feline coronaviral enteritis, caused by the feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), typically results in a subclinical or mild, transient intestinal infection in kittens. The most common clinical signs associated with FECV infection include diarrhea and upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, watery eyes, and nasal discharge [1]. These mild signs are usually self-limiting.

However, in approximately 5-10% of FECV-infected cats, the virus can mutate and transform into the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) [2]. This mutated form of the virus is capable of infecting immune cells and spreading systemically, leading to the development of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [3]. 

Cats with FIP can present with a variety of clinical signs, depending on the form of the disease. The "wet" or effusive form is characterized by the accumulation of fluid in body cavities, such as the abdomen and/or chest, causing a distended, pot-bellied appearance and respiratory distress [1,2]. The "dry" or non-effusive form is associated with the development of granulomatous lesions in organs, such as the kidneys, liver, intestines, eyes, and central nervous system, leading to clinical signs like neurological abnormalities, uveitis, and organ dysfunction [1,2].

Regardless of the form, cats with FIP often display nonspecific signs at the onset, including fever, lethargy, anorexia, and weight loss [1,2]. As the disease progresses, the clinical presentation becomes more severe and organ-specific. Accurate diagnosis of FIP remains challenging, as there is no single definitive test, and a combination of clinical signs, laboratory findings, and diagnostic imaging is typically required [1,3].

## Diagnostic Methods

Feline coronaviral enteritis can be diagnosed through a combination of clinical presentation and laboratory testing. While there is no definitive diagnostic test, several methods can be used to identify the presence of the virus.

Clinical signs of feline coronaviral enteritis often include lethargy, loss of appetite, and mild diarrhea. In some cases, cats may develop a distended abdomen or experience difficulty breathing due to fluid accumulation. However, these signs are not specific to coronaviral infection and can occur with other gastrointestinal disorders.

Laboratory testing plays a key role in diagnosis. Fecal samples can be analyzed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the presence of feline coronavirus genetic material. This test can identify active viral shedding, but a single positive result does not necessarily indicate clinical disease [1]. 

Serology can also be used to detect antibodies to feline coronavirus, which indicates prior exposure. However, the presence of antibodies does not differentiate between the common enteric form of the virus and the mutated strain that causes feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [2,3]. Antibody titers can fluctuate unpredictably and do not reliably predict the development of FIP.

In cases where FIP is suspected, analysis of effusions (fluid accumulations) in the abdomen or chest can provide more definitive evidence. These effusions often have a high protein content and low cell counts, which is characteristic of FIP [2,3]. Immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence testing on cells in the effusion can also detect the presence of coronavirus antigens.

Overall, diagnosing feline coronaviral enteritis relies on a combination of clinical signs, viral detection, and ruling out other potential causes. Regular veterinary monitoring and judicious use of laboratory tests are important to identify persistent viral shedders and manage disease in multi-cat environments.

## Treatment Options

Feline coronaviral enteritis typically causes a subclinical or mild, transient intestinal infection in kittens. Most cases do not require therapy, but supportive care may be needed if signs are severe [1]. There is no specific antiviral therapy for feline coronaviral enteritis [1].

The mild, transient clinical signs of feline coronaviral enteritis are unlikely to require therapy. Treatment, if required, is symptomatic and supportive (i.e. fluid therapy, oral electrolyte solutions, antiemetics) [1]. Identification of feline coronavirus (FCoV) carrier cats requires nine monthly, consecutive positive fecal RT-PCR tests, whereas identification of a cat that has eliminated FCoV infection requires five consecutive negative fecal RT-PCR tests [1].

Control and prevention of FCoV infection are usually a concern only in breeding catteries and rescue shelters. Ingestion of virus-contaminated fecal particles should be prevented as much as possible. Fecal contamination of the environment can be minimized with sufficient litter box numbers, daily litter box cleaning, weekly litter box disinfection, and clipping/cleaning fur from the hind end of long-haired cats [1]. Cats should be housed in small (three or four cats), closed groups with disinfection between groups [1]. Seropositive cats can be retested every 3-6 months and moved into seronegative groups as their antibody titer decreases [1].

Vaccination with an intranasal, temperature-sensitive FCoV mutant is not generally recommended but can be considered in seronegative cats >16 weeks old introduced into an FCoV-endemic environment [1]. Vaccination will lead to seroconversion and does not completely protect cats previously exposed to FCoV from developing feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [1].

## Preventive Measures

The best way to prevent feline coronaviral enteritis is through good hygiene and environmental management practices. Key preventive measures include:

[1] Regular cleaning of litter boxes, feeding areas, and cat carriers to minimize fecal contamination and reduce viral transmission. Disinfecting these surfaces with appropriate cleaners can help inactivate the virus.

[2] Avoiding overcrowding in multi-cat households or catteries. Reducing stress and limiting the number of cats can lower the risk of FCoV infection and spread.

[3] Keeping vaccination protocols up-to-date. While there is no specific FCoV vaccine, maintaining a cat's core vaccinations (e.g. against feline panleukopenia, herpesvirus, and calicivirus) can help strengthen their overall immune response.

[4] Practicing good personal hygiene, such as handwashing after handling cats or cleaning litter boxes. This prevents the transfer of virus particles to other cats.

[5] Isolating infected cats to prevent them from shedding virus and exposing other cats. Persistent FCoV shedders should be identified and separated from healthy cats.

[6] Providing a stress-free environment for cats, as stress can impair their immune defenses and increase susceptibility to FCoV infection.

By implementing these preventive measures, cat owners and caretakers can significantly reduce the risk of feline coronaviral enteritis and the potential progression to the more severe feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in multi-cat settings. Regular veterinary check-ups are also crucial for early detection and management of any FCoV-related issues.

## Differential Diagnosis

When a cat presents with symptoms similar to feline coronaviral enteritis, it is important to consider other potential causes that can lead to comparable clinical signs. Some key differential diagnoses include:

[1] Toxoplasmosis - A parasitic infection that can cause fever, lethargy, and neurological signs similar to FIP. Requires different diagnostic tests and treatment.

[2] Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) - A retrovirus that can predispose cats to various illnesses, including those resembling FIP. FeLV testing is crucial to differentiate.  

[3] Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) - Another immunosuppressive retroviral infection that may increase susceptibility to opportunistic infections mimicking FIP.

[4] Feline Panleukopenia Virus (FPV) - A highly contagious parvovirus that can lead to gastrointestinal and hematological changes overlapping with FIP.

[5] Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) - A chronic intestinal condition that may present with vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss like FIP.

[6] Neoplasia - Various forms of cancer, such as lymphoma, can show systemic effects resembling FIP.

[7] Bacterial Infections - Bacterial peritonitis or pleuritis can cause fluid accumulation and other clinical signs akin to the effusive form of FIP.

[8] Cryptococcosis - A fungal infection that may cause neurological abnormalities and other signs comparable to the non-effusive FIP.

In summary, while feline coronaviral enteritis is a common cause of gastrointestinal and systemic disease in cats, veterinarians must thoroughly evaluate the patient, consider multiple differential diagnoses, and utilize appropriate diagnostic testing to differentiate FIP from these other potential etiologies. This is crucial for implementing the correct management and treatment approach.
