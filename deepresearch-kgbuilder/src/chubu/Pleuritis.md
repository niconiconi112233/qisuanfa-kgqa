## Disease Overview

Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura, the thin lining that covers the lungs and lines the inside of the chest wall. This causes sharp chest pain that worsens with breathing movements. [1] Pleurisy has a variety of potential causes, including viral or bacterial infections, autoimmune diseases, lung cancer, and certain medications. [2] 

The epidemiology of pleurisy has shifted over time, with recent studies showing changing trends in the causes and healthcare utilization for pleural infections. [3,4] While viral infections remain a common cause, the incidence of pleural infections overall appears to be increasing, with certain patient populations at higher risk. [3,4] There are also indications that treatment approaches are evolving, with a greater tendency toward earlier use of interventions like tube thoracostomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. [3]

Overall, pleurisy remains an important clinical condition with the potential for significant morbidity. Understanding the epidemiological trends and changing management approaches is important for providing optimal care for patients with this condition.

## Common Pathogens

The most common viral causes of pleuritis are coxsackie B virus and echovirus. Coxsackie B virus is the primary cause of viral pleuritis, while echovirus can cause a rare condition called epidemic pleurodynia (Bornholm pleurodynia) characterized by pleuritis, fever, and chest muscle spasms.[1]

Bacterial infections are another common cause of pleuritis. Key bacterial pathogens include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which can lead to pneumonia and associated pleuritis.[2,6] Tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis can also result in pleuritis.[6]

In addition to viral and bacterial infections, pleuritis can arise from autoimmune conditions like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as from lung diseases, chest injuries, and pulmonary embolisms.[3-5,7-9]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Pleural effusion in companion animals can cause a variety of clinical symptoms and signs. The most common ones include:

[1] Difficulty breathing: Dogs and cats with pleural effusion often exhibit rapid, shallow breathing, open-mouth breathing, and increased respiratory effort. As the fluid accumulates, it restricts lung expansion, leading to respiratory distress. [1,2,3]

[2] Coughing: Persistent coughing can occur, especially if the pleural effusion is secondary to an underlying respiratory infection. [1,2,3]

[3] Pain: Affected animals may show signs of pain, such as reluctance to move, vocalizing when touched, or adopting a hunched posture. [1,2]

[4] Fever: An elevated body temperature can indicate an underlying infection or inflammation. [1,2]

[5] Loss of appetite and lethargy: Dogs with pleural effusion may lose interest in food and show decreased energy or activity levels. [1,2,3]

[6] Abnormal posture: Animals may adopt specific postures, such as leaning forward or stretching their necks, to ease their breathing. [1,2]

[7] Muffled heart and lung sounds: On auscultation, the heart and lung sounds may be muffled due to the presence of fluid in the pleural space. [4]

[8] Dull percussion sounds: Percussion of the chest may reveal dull, hyporesonant sounds over the areas of pleural fluid accumulation. [4]

The severity of the clinical signs usually corresponds to the volume of fluid in the pleural cavity and the underlying cause of the effusion. Prompt recognition and treatment of pleural effusion is crucial, as it can be a life-threatening condition in companion animals.

## Diagnostic Methods

The clinical presentation of pleurisy can be variable, ranging from a relatively young patient with fever, respiratory symptoms, and a non-resolving pneumonia to an insidious presentation in elderly patients with non-specific symptoms like weight loss and malaise. While there are certain risk factors that can predispose patients to pleuritic inflammation, there are currently no validated clinical prediction tools to determine which patients with pneumonia will progress to pleural infection.

Imaging plays an important role in the diagnostic evaluation. Chest radiography can detect the presence of pleural effusion, but has limited sensitivity. Thoracic ultrasound is a useful bedside tool that can identify features suggestive of pleural infection, such as septations and loculations, and guide safe sampling of pleural fluid. Computed tomography of the chest, while not as specific as ultrasound, can provide additional information on pleural abnormalities and help predict the need for drainage.

Ultimately, analysis of the pleural fluid remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Macroscopically purulent fluid is diagnostic of pleural infection. When the fluid is non-purulent, biochemical markers like pH, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase can help guide management. Novel biomarkers like soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) show promise in diagnosis and prognosis, but require further validation.

Microbiological testing, including pleural fluid culture and newer techniques like 16S rRNA PCR, are important to identify the causative organism(s). The microbiology of pleural infection is complex, with a high incidence of polymicrobial infections and an increasing role of organisms like Staphylococcus aureus. Understanding the microbiology can help guide appropriate antibiotic therapy and predict clinical outcomes.

In summary, the diagnosis of pleurisy involves a multi-modal approach incorporating clinical history, imaging, pleural fluid analysis, and microbiology. Early recognition and accurate diagnosis are crucial to guide appropriate management and improve outcomes in this challenging condition. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]

## Treatment Options

The treatment for pleurisy focuses on addressing the underlying cause and managing the associated symptoms. The key treatment approaches include:

[1] Medications:
- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain. [30][31]
- Corticosteroids may be prescribed for more severe inflammation. 
- Antibiotics may be used if the pleurisy is caused by a bacterial infection.
- Antiviral medications may be given if the pleurisy is viral in origin.

[2] Fluid drainage:
- If excess fluid builds up in the pleural space, a thoracentesis procedure may be done to drain the fluid. This can help relieve pressure and pain. [29]

[3] Supportive care:
- Resting and avoiding activities that exacerbate the pain.
- Using a pillow to support the chest wall when coughing or moving.
- Maintaining good hydration and nutrition.
- Applying heat packs to the painful area.

[4] Treating the underlying condition:
- If pleurisy is caused by an underlying disease like cancer, autoimmune disorder, or lung condition, treating that condition is key.

The goal of treatment is to relieve the patient's symptoms while also addressing the root cause of the pleurisy. With proper management, most cases of pleurisy resolve within 1-2 weeks.

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination and environmental management strategies are key to preventing pleurisy:

[1] Practice good respiratory hygiene. Adopt measures like covering coughs/sneezes, disposing of tissues properly, and frequent handwashing to prevent respiratory infections that can lead to pleurisy. [9]

[2] Get recommended vaccinations. Stay up-to-date on influenza and pneumonia vaccines, which can significantly reduce the risk of pleurisy caused by viral or bacterial infections. [12]

[3] Avoid smoking and exposure to environmental toxins. Smoking and exposure to pollutants like asbestos can damage the lungs and increase inflammation, raising the risk of pleurisy. [5]

[4] Manage underlying health conditions. Proper treatment of chronic lung diseases, autoimmune disorders, and other conditions that predispose to pleurisy can help prevent flare-ups. [3,10]

[5] Practice safe behaviors. Take precautions to prevent chest injuries that can lead to pleurisy, such as wearing seatbelts and using protective gear during physical activities. [10]

## Differential Diagnosis

Pleuritis has a broad differential diagnosis that includes both common and uncommon causes. The most important considerations are to rule out life-threatening conditions like pulmonary embolism, acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, and pneumothorax.[1] Pneumonia is another common cause that must be evaluated.

Some other common causes of pleuritic chest pain include viral pleuritis, nonmesothelioma malignancies, and pneumothorax.[1] Less common etiologies include asbestos-related pleural disease, mesothelioma, tuberculosis, connective tissue disorders, drug reactions, postcardiac injury syndrome, uremia, cirrhosis, and pancreatitis.[1]

A thorough history and physical exam, combined with appropriate diagnostic testing, is crucial to identify the underlying cause. Key elements to elicit include the time course of symptom onset, associated symptoms, risk factors, and exposures. Clinicians should also evaluate for signs of serious underlying conditions on exam. Imaging with chest radiography is often the first step, which may reveal pneumonia, effusions, or other abnormalities. Additional testing like electrocardiography, d-dimer, and possibly CT imaging may be warranted based on the clinical presentation.[1,2]

In summary, the differential diagnosis for pleuritis is broad, and prompt evaluation is needed to exclude life-threatening causes and identify the underlying etiology in order to guide appropriate management.
