## Disease Overview

Campylobacteriosis is among the most common infections caused by a bacterium in humans, often as a foodborne illness. It is caused by the Campylobacter bacterium, most commonly C. jejuni. It produces an inflammatory, sometimes bloody, diarrhea or dysentery syndrome, and usually cramps, fever and pain.[1] 

The prodromal symptoms are fever, headache, and myalgia, which can be severe, lasting as long as 24 hours. After 1–5 days, typically, these are followed by diarrhea (as many as 10 watery, frequently bloody, bowel movements per day) or dysentery, cramps, abdominal pain, and fever as high as 40 °C (104 °F). In most people, the illness lasts for 2–10 days.[2][3]

Complications can include toxic megacolon, dehydration and sepsis. Chronic campylobacteriosis features a long period of sub-febrile temperature and asthenia, and eye damage, arthritis, endocarditis may develop if infection is untreated. Some individuals develop Guillain-Barré syndrome, in which the nerves that join the spinal cord and brain to the rest of the body are damaged, sometimes permanently.[4][5]

## Common Pathogens

Campylobacteriosis, an infection caused by Campylobacter bacteria, is a common problem in both dogs and cats. Several species of Campylobacter have been associated with intestinal disease in companion animals, including C. jejuni, C. coli, C. upsaliensis, and C. helveticus.[1] 

C. jejuni is the most well-studied Campylobacter species and is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in humans worldwide.[2] This pathogen can also infect dogs and cats, causing acute diarrhea that is sometimes bloody or mucoid. Puppies and kittens under 6 months of age are most susceptible, likely due to their immature immune systems.[3] 

In addition to C. jejuni, C. upsaliensis and C. helveticus have also been linked to intestinal disease in companion animals. These species can cause similar clinical signs of enteritis, though their pathogenic role is less certain as they are also commonly isolated from healthy animals.[3,4]

While many dogs and cats harbor Campylobacter asymptomatically, these animals can still serve as reservoirs and transmit the bacteria to humans, especially young children. Proper hygiene, including hand washing after handling pets, is important to prevent zoonotic transmission.[5]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Campylobacteriosis can cause a range of clinical symptoms in dogs and cats, particularly in younger animals. The most common signs include vomiting and watery diarrhea that may contain mucus and sometimes blood [1]. Other potential symptoms are cramping, abdominal pain, and fever [1]. While adult dogs and cats often show no symptoms, younger animals and those from intensive housing backgrounds are more susceptible to developing clinical disease [1,2].

## Diagnostic Methods

Campylobacteriosis is typically diagnosed through laboratory testing. The most common methods include:

[1] Stool culture - Campylobacter bacteria are grown from a stool sample using selective media under microaerophilic conditions. This allows identification of the specific Campylobacter species. [6][16]

[2] Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) - These rapid molecular tests can directly detect Campylobacter DNA in stool samples without the need for culturing. They are more sensitive than culture. [16][17][18] 

[3] Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) - These tests detect Campylobacter antigens in stool samples, providing faster results than culture but with lower sensitivity compared to NAATs. Positive EIA results should be confirmed by culture or NAAT. [19][20]

Stool culture remains an important method as it allows isolating the bacteria for further characterization, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and molecular subtyping during outbreak investigations. [21][22] The use of both culture and advanced diagnostic methods like NAATs can provide the most comprehensive approach to diagnose Campylobacter infections.

## Treatment Options

Most people with a _Campylobacter_ infection recover without needing antibiotics. The main treatment focuses on preventing dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids.

Antibiotics may be prescribed for certain high-risk groups, such as those who are immunocompromised, pregnant, or over 65 years old. Macrolide antibiotics like erythromycin are commonly used to treat _Campylobacter_ infections. However, there is increasing antibiotic resistance, so the choice of antibiotic may depend on susceptibility testing.

For otherwise healthy individuals, the infection is usually self-limiting and resolves within a week. Supportive care with fluids and electrolyte replacement is the mainstay of treatment. Anti-diarrheal medications should be avoided as they can prolong the illness. 

Healthcare providers play a key role in monitoring high-risk patients closely and determining if antibiotic treatment is warranted based on the individual's symptoms and risk factors. The interprofessional team, including primary care providers, nurses, and specialists, should collaborate to provide comprehensive care and prevent complications.

## Preventive Measures

Campylobacteriosis can be prevented through a combination of vaccination and environmental management strategies on the farm.

Vaccination should be implemented as soon as campylobacteriosis is diagnosed on a farm. Infected cows and at-risk cows should be vaccinated, as this can hasten the elimination of Campylobacter fetus from the herd and improve fertility, even though cows may remain carriers [1,6]. Bulls should also be vaccinated, as they can act as reservoirs and transmit the infection.

In addition to vaccination, several environmental management strategies can help control and prevent campylobacteriosis on the farm:

- Maintain strict biosecurity measures, including proper hygiene, disinfection protocols, and limiting access to the farm [1,3]. This helps prevent the introduction and spread of Campylobacter.
- Avoid partial depopulation (thinning) of flocks, as this can compromise biosecurity and increase the risk of Campylobacter contamination [1,2]. 
- Ensure thorough cleaning and disinfection between flocks, with an extended downtime of at least 14 days to decrease the possibility of residual Campylobacter contamination [1,3].
- Carefully manage water sources, as Campylobacter can survive well in water. Chlorination of water is effective against the bacteria [1,13].
- Control flies and other vectors that can mechanically transmit Campylobacter between the environment and animals [1,11].
- Limit contact between cattle, poultry, and other livestock, as cross-contamination can occur [1,13].

By implementing a comprehensive vaccination program along with rigorous on-farm biosecurity and environmental management practices, the risk of campylobacteriosis can be significantly reduced.

## Differential Diagnosis

The clinical manifestation of campylobacteriosis is often similar to other bacterial causes of gastroenteritis, including Escherichia coli, Listeria, and Clostridioides difficile. [1] The differential diagnosis can also include viral causes of gastroenteritis such as norovirus, bacterial toxins such as those produced by Staphylococcus, and parasitic infections, such as Cryptosporidium.

Campylobacteriosis may present with symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting, which can be difficult to distinguish from other bacterial gastroenteritis. However, some key differences include:

- Duration of symptoms: Campylobacteriosis typically resolves within 1 week, while other bacterial gastroenteritis may last longer (e.g. Salmonella, Shigella).
- Presence of bloody diarrhea: Campylobacter infections are more likely to cause bloody diarrhea compared to some other bacteria like E. coli.
- Associated neurological complications: Campylobacter infection is uniquely associated with the development of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare neurological disorder causing muscle weakness and paralysis. This complication is not seen with other common bacterial gastroenteritis. [2]

Additionally, the differential diagnosis should consider:

- Viral gastroenteritis (e.g. norovirus) - may present similarly but with shorter duration of symptoms
- Toxin-mediated food poisoning (e.g. Staphylococcus) - typically causes vomiting rather than diarrhea
- Parasitic infections (e.g. Cryptosporidium, Giardia) - may cause more prolonged diarrheal illness

Ultimately, stool culture, PCR, or antigen testing is required to confirm the specific bacterial pathogen causing the gastroenteritis.
