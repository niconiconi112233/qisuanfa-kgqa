## Disease Overview

Cryptorchidism, also known as undescended testicle, is the failure of one or both testes to descend into the scrotum before birth. It is the most common birth defect of the male genital tract, affecting around 3% of full-term and 30% of premature infant boys. [1] 

The testes normally develop in the abdominal cavity and descend into the scrotum during fetal development. In cryptorchidism, this process is disrupted, leaving the testis in an abnormal location, usually in the inguinal canal or abdomen. About 80% of cases resolve spontaneously within the first year of life, but the remaining cases require surgical treatment (orchiopexy) to bring the testis into the scrotum. [2]

Cryptorchidism is associated with an increased risk of infertility and testicular cancer later in life. Without treatment, undescended testes are more susceptible to testicular torsion and inguinal hernias. Early surgical correction is recommended to improve fertility outcomes and facilitate cancer surveillance. [3]

The epidemiology of cryptorchidism shows notable geographic and temporal variation, with prevalence ranging from 1-9% globally. Preterm birth, low birth weight, and certain environmental exposures like maternal smoking appear to be risk factors. The underlying causes are multifactorial, involving both genetic and environmental influences on testicular development and descent. [4,5]

## Common Pathogens

Cryptorchidism does not appear to be directly associated with any specific viral, bacterial, or other causative agents. Cryptorchidism is a congenital condition caused by a failure of the testicles to properly descend from the abdomen into the scrotum. It is believed to have a genetic basis and is often seen in certain dog breeds, but there is no clear evidence linking it to infectious pathogens. [1,2,3]

The main risks associated with cryptorchidism are the increased likelihood of testicular torsion and testicular cancer in the undescended testicle. However, the condition itself is not caused by an infectious agent. Treatment typically involves surgical removal of the retained testicle(s) to prevent these complications. [4,5]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Cryptorchidism is a relatively common condition in dogs, occurring in approximately 1-3% of male dogs. It is more commonly seen in certain breeds, such as Yorkshire terriers, Pomeranians, and brachycephalic breeds.

In dogs with cryptorchidism, one or both testicles fail to descend into the scrotum by 8 weeks of age. Affected dogs may have no palpable testicles in the scrotum, or one testicle may be present while the other is retained internally. The retained testicle(s) can be located in the abdomen, inguinal canal, or other locations. 

Cryptorchid dogs typically do not exhibit overt clinical signs, as the retained testicle(s) can continue to produce testosterone and maintain normal male secondary sex characteristics. However, dogs with cryptorchidism are at increased risk of testicular torsion and testicular cancer in the retained testicle(s). Additionally, cryptorchid males are often infertile if both testicles are retained, as the higher abdominal temperature impairs sperm production.

In cats, cryptorchidism is less common, occurring in only about 1% of male cats. The Persian breed is the most commonly affected. Similar to dogs, cryptorchid cats may have no palpable testicles or only one descended testicle. Unlike dogs, it may be possible to visually differentiate between a castrated cat and one with retained testicles, as cryptorchid cats have penile barbs.

## Diagnostic Methods

The diagnosis of cryptorchidism is primarily made through physical examination. Providers should palpate the testes during routine well-child visits to assess for proper testicular descent [1,2]. If a testicle is not palpable in the scrotum, it may be undescended.

Providers should refer infants with a history of cryptorchidism who do not have spontaneous testicular descent by 6 months (corrected gestational age) to a surgical specialist for evaluation [3]. Boys with the possibility of newly diagnosed (acquired) cryptorchidism after 6 months should also be referred to a specialist [4].

Imaging studies are not recommended in the initial evaluation of cryptorchidism, as they have limited accuracy and rarely assist in decision-making [6]. Laboratory tests may be indicated if there are concerns for a disorder of sex development, such as measuring MÃ¼llerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS) levels in boys with bilateral, non-palpable testes [8].

## Treatment Options

The key treatment options for managing cryptorchidism include:

Medical Therapy:
[1] Hormonal therapy using human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) can be used to try to induce testicular descent, but has low response rates and lacks evidence for long-term efficacy.[1] 

Surgical Therapy:
[2] Orchidopexy is the standard surgical treatment, where the undescended testis is surgically repositioned into the scrotum.[1,3] Orchidopexy should be performed between 12-24 months of age, as earlier treatment improves fertility outcomes.[1,3]

[3] For nonpalpable testes, examination under anesthesia followed by abdominal exploration and orchidopexy is recommended.[1]

[4] Orchiectomy may be performed if the undescended testis is severely atrophic or dysmorphic, or if the boy has reached puberty.[1]

Overall, early surgical intervention via orchidopexy is the recommended approach, as it reduces the risks of testicular malignancy and preserves fertility potential better than hormonal therapy alone.[1,3,4] Lifelong monitoring and counseling is also important for men with a history of cryptorchidism.[1]

Here is a section on preventive measures for cryptorchidism:

## Preventive Measures

There is no exact way to prevent undescended testicles. With that said, it is important for the mother to engage in a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy to decrease the risk. Some ways to do this include engaging in regular checkups, not smoking or consuming alcohol, or following certain dietary restrictions.[1] Maintaining a healthy pregnancy and avoiding potential risk factors like preterm birth or intrauterine growth restriction can help reduce the chances of cryptorchidism. However, there are no guaranteed prevention strategies, as the condition can have both genetic and environmental contributors.[2,3]

## Differential Diagnosis

The key differential diagnoses for cryptorchidism include:

1. Normal retractile testis: The testis is seen intermittently in the scrotum and can be pulled to the base of the scrotum with minimal traction [1].

2. True undescended testis (palpable or impalpable): The testis is located along the normal descent pathway but cannot be manipulated to the base of the scrotum [1,2].

3. Exaggerated cremasteric reflex: This can simulate the appearance of a cryptorchid testis [3].

4. Disorders of sexual development: Patients with bilateral non-palpable undescended testes should undergo endocrinologic evaluation for underlying disorders of sexual development [4,5].

5. Retractile testis: A variant of cryptorchidism where the testis is intermittently pulled up into the inguinal canal. These should be monitored annually until puberty [5].

The accurate diagnosis of cryptorchidism is crucial to guide appropriate management and timely surgical intervention to reduce the risk of testicular cancer and preserve fertility.

# Cryptorchidism

Cryptorchidism, the failure of one or both testicles to descend into the scrotum, is the most common birth defect of the male genital tract. This report synthesizes authoritative sources to provide a comprehensive overview of the disease, including its clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, treatment options, and preventive measures. Early surgical intervention via orchidopexy is the recommended approach, as it reduces the risks of testicular malignancy and preserves fertility potential better than hormonal therapy alone. While there are no guaranteed prevention strategies, maintaining a healthy pregnancy and avoiding potential risk factors can help reduce the chances of this condition.

## Conclusion

Cryptorchidism is a complex condition with both genetic and environmental contributors. Timely diagnosis and treatment are crucial to mitigate the associated risks of testicular torsion, inguinal hernias, and infertility. The report highlights the importance of regular physical examinations, prompt referral to specialists, and early surgical intervention to optimize outcomes for affected individuals. While preventive measures are limited, the findings emphasize the need for continued research to better understand the underlying causes and develop more effective strategies to address this common genital tract disorder.
