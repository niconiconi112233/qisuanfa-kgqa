## Disease Overview

Feline panleukopenia is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cats worldwide. It is caused by the feline parvovirus (FPV), a single-stranded DNA virus closely related to canine parvovirus. 

FPV primarily targets rapidly dividing cells, such as those in the intestines, bone marrow, and lymphoid tissues. This can lead to a severe drop in white blood cells, compromising the cat's immune system. The virus is highly resistant to inactivation and can persist in the environment for up to a year.

Cats become infected through direct contact with infected animals, their bodily fluids, or contaminated surfaces and objects. Kittens and unvaccinated cats are most susceptible, with mortality rates reaching 90-100% in untreated cases. Clinical signs include fever, depression, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. Sudden death can occur, especially in young kittens.

Outbreaks of feline panleukopenia are common in animal shelters, especially when kittens are housed together and vaccination is not provided at intake. Factors like the cat's age, vaccination status, and housing conditions can influence the risk of infection and disease severity. Prompt diagnosis, isolation, and vaccination are critical for controlling outbreaks and preventing further spread of this potentially fatal disease. [1,2]

## Common Pathogens

Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), also known as feline distemper, is a highly contagious, life-threatening viral disease in cats [1]. FPV is closely related to canine parvovirus (CPV), and both can cause disease in cats [1,2]. While FPV is the primary cause of feline panleukopenia, some cases in cats have been attributed to CPV variants [2,3].

FPV is a non-enveloped DNA virus that infects and destroys rapidly dividing cells, particularly in the intestines and bone marrow [1,4]. Infected cats shed large amounts of virus in all body secretions, enabling easy transmission through direct contact or contaminated environments [1,4]. The virus is highly resistant to inactivation and can persist in the environment for up to a year [1,4]. 

In addition to FPV, other pathogens that can contribute to feline panleukopenia include:

- Feline leukemia virus (FeLV): FPV infections are often more severe in cats co-infected with FeLV, which suppresses the immune system [4].
- Intestinal parasites: Parasitic infections, commonly seen in shelter environments, can complicate panleukopenia by contributing to dehydration and malabsorption [4].

Overall, feline panleukopenia is primarily caused by the highly contagious and environmentally resilient FPV, but other underlying infections can exacerbate the disease. Proper vaccination, biosecurity, and treatment of concurrent conditions are essential for managing this serious feline disease.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Feline panleukopenia is a highly contagious, often fatal viral disease that primarily affects kittens and young, unvaccinated cats. The virus targets rapidly dividing cells, particularly in the intestinal tract, bone marrow, and lymphoid tissues.

The most common clinical signs include:

- High fever (typically 104-107Â°F)
- Severe vomiting and diarrhea, sometimes with blood 
- Profound lethargy and depression
- Complete loss of appetite
- Rapid dehydration due to fluid and electrolyte losses

Other symptoms may include:

- Hypothermia as the disease progresses
- Hypoglycemia
- Abdominal pain and discomfort
- Rough or unkempt hair coat

Peracute cases, especially in kittens, may result in sudden death with little to no warning. More commonly, cats will develop acute illness within 2-7 days of exposure, with the disease progressing rapidly. 

The severe vomiting and diarrhea lead to rapid dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and secondary infections that can quickly become life-threatening if not aggressively treated. Kittens under 5 months of age are at the highest risk of dying from panleukopenia.

## Diagnostic Methods

Feline panleukopenia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of clinical signs, laboratory testing, and other diagnostic methods.

The most common approach is to start with the patient's history and clinical presentation. Kittens and unvaccinated cats exhibiting symptoms like fever, lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration are highly suspicious for panleukopenia [1].

Laboratory testing is crucial for confirming the diagnosis. A point-of-care ELISA test that detects feline parvovirus (FPV) antigen in fecal or vomitus samples can provide rapid results [9,10]. These tests are reasonably sensitive and highly specific, though false negatives can occur, especially early in the course of infection [9]. 

Additionally, a complete blood count (CBC) may reveal the characteristic severe neutropenia and lymphopenia associated with panleukopenia [1]. Quantitative PCR testing on fecal, blood, or tissue samples can detect the presence and amount of FPV DNA, providing more definitive confirmation [13,14].

In some cases, immunofluorescence staining of intestinal tissue samples can be used to visualize the FPV antigen directly [1]. Virus isolation in cell culture is another option, though less practical for routine diagnosis [1].

Ultimately, a combination of clinical signs, ELISA, CBC, and potentially PCR or other advanced testing allows veterinarians to make a confident diagnosis of feline panleukopenia [1,9,10]. Recognizing that recent vaccination can lead to false positive results on some tests is also important when interpreting the findings [9].

## Treatment Options

Feline panleukopenia is a serious viral disease that requires a multi-faceted treatment approach to address the various complications and life-threatening aspects of the infection. The cornerstone of successful treatment involves the following key elements:

[1] Immediate Hospitalization and Supportive Care
Cats diagnosed with panleukopenia require hospitalization for intensive monitoring and supportive therapies. This includes maintaining proper body temperature, preventing dehydration through IV fluid therapy, and providing a quiet, stress-free environment. Isolation protocols are crucial to prevent transmission to other patients.

[2] Aggressive Fluid Therapy
Intravenous fluid administration is essential to correct dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base disturbances caused by the severe vomiting and diarrhea. Fluids containing balanced electrolytes and supplemental potassium are typically provided.

[3] Nutritional Support
Cats with panleukopenia often refuse food due to nausea and intestinal damage. A highly digestible, calorie-dense diet is provided, sometimes through syringe feeding or feeding tubes if the cat will not eat voluntarily. This supports healing of the intestinal tract.

[4] Antibiotic Therapy
Broad-spectrum antibiotics are crucial to prevent and treat secondary bacterial infections that can arise due to the compromised immune system. Common choices include ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and fluoroquinolones.

[5] Anti-nausea Medications
Drugs like maropitant, ondansetron, and metoclopramide are used to control the severe vomiting that can lead to further dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

[6] Blood Transfusions
In severe cases, especially in young kittens, blood transfusions may be necessary to provide red blood cells, plasma proteins, and clotting factors to support the cat through the critical phase of illness.

[7] Home Care and Recovery Support
Once the cat has stabilized enough to be discharged, continued care at home is essential. This includes administering medications, monitoring hydration, and providing a quiet, isolated environment until the cat has fully recovered and stopped shedding the virus, which can take 2-3 weeks.

Vaccination remains the most effective means of prevention, as the disease is highly contagious and the virus is environmentally hardy. Proper disinfection of contaminated areas is also crucial to stop the spread of panleukopenia.

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is a critical lifesaving tool for preventing feline panleukopenia. All cats four weeks of age and older entering a shelter environment should be vaccinated at intake as reflected in vaccination guidelines for shelter-housed cats [1]. The vaccine starts working quickly and can provide immunity within hours. 

Proper sanitation is also essential for preventing the spread of feline panleukopenia. A shelter's standard sanitation protocol should include products and processes that kill non-enveloped viruses, such as accelerated hydrogen peroxide, potassium peroxymonosulfate, and dilute bleach at appropriate dilutions and contact times [1]. Thorough cleaning of organic matter before disinfection is required.

Housing that separates animals into smaller groups based on species, health, age, and other factors helps maintain optimum animal health during a shelter stay. Primary enclosures that allow sanitation and care without handling can reduce stress and minimize opportunities for feline panleukopenia transmission [1].

Population management strategies that promote pathway planning and minimize length of stay also help control feline panleukopenia transmission and enable other preventive strategies to be most effective [1].

## Differential Diagnosis

There are several diseases with similar symptoms that should be considered in the differential diagnosis for feline panleukopenia:

[1] Salmonellosis can cause severe gastrointestinal signs, fever, and leukopenia in cats, similar to feline panleukopenia. [2]

[2] Acute poisoning, such as from ingestion of rodenticides or other toxins, can also present with vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and lethargy. [2]

[3] Feline lymphoma virus infection can cause non-specific clinical signs like anorexia, lethargy, and fever, though it does not typically result in the profound leukopenia seen with panleukopenia. [1]

[4] Other viral enteritides affecting cats, such as feline enteric coronavirus, rotavirus, calicivirus, and astrovirus, may also cause diarrhea and gastrointestinal distress, but often with less severe clinical signs compared to panleukopenia. [2]

[5] Parasitic infections like giardiasis and nematode infestations can lead to diarrhea and gastrointestinal signs that overlap with panleukopenia. [2]

Ultimately, a combination of signalment, clinical signs, complete blood count, and diagnostic testing (ELISA, PCR) is required to differentiate feline panleukopenia from these other potential causes of acute gastrointestinal disease in cats.
