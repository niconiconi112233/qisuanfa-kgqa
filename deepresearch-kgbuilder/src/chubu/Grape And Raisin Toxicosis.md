## Disease Overview

Grape/raisin toxicosis is a condition caused by the ingestion of grapes, raisins, currants or other members of the *Vitis* genus. Ingestion can lead to acute kidney injury and potentially fatal renal failure in dogs and possibly other animals.

The exact toxic agent in grapes and raisins has been identified as tartaric acid, which dogs are particularly sensitive to as they lack efficient mechanisms to excrete it. Ingestion of even small amounts can overwhelm the kidneys and lead to rapid development of kidney failure, often within 24-72 hours [6,10].

Grape/raisin toxicosis was first reported in the 1980s and is well-documented in dogs, with a few anecdotal reports in cats and ferrets [6]. The condition is uncommon but potentially life-threatening, making it an important consideration for veterinarians when pets present with sudden-onset kidney disease.

### Key Points:
- Grapes, raisins, currants and other *Vitis* spp. are toxic to dogs, potentially causing acute kidney injury
- Tartaric acid is the likely toxic agent, which dogs are unable to effectively excrete
- Ingestion can lead to rapid development of kidney failure, often within 1-3 days
- Condition is well-documented in dogs, with a few reports in cats and ferrets

## Pathogenesis

The proposed mechanism of toxicity for grapes and raisins is believed to be related to their high concentration of tartaric acid. Tartaric acid is an organic acid that is present in high levels in grapes, raisins, and tamarinds.[1,2] 

Dogs are sensitive to the nephrotoxic effects of tartaric acid because they lack the organic acid transporters that other species possess. This allows the tartaric acid to accumulate in the proximal renal tubular cells, leading to tubular degeneration and necrosis.[1,3] The tartaric acid content can vary between different grape and raisin varieties, as well as based on factors like location and ripeness, resulting in variable toxicity.[1]

In addition to grapes and raisins, ingestion of other foods containing tartaric acid, such as cream of tartar and tamarind, have also been associated with the development of acute kidney injury in dogs with a similar clinical presentation.[1,3] This further supports the role of tartaric acid as the likely toxic principle underlying grape and raisin toxicosis.

## Clinical Symptoms

The typical gastrointestinal, neurological, and renal symptoms observed in dogs and cats with grape/raisin toxicosis include:

[1] Vomiting and diarrhea within 6-12 hours of ingestion. The vomitus may contain pieces of the ingested grapes or raisins. [2] Lethargy, anorexia, increased thirst (polydipsia), and dehydration. [3] Progression to oliguric (low urine output) or anuric (no urine output) renal failure within 24-48 hours. This is accompanied by elevations in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentrations. [1,2]

In some cases, transient increases in serum glucose, liver enzymes, pancreatic enzymes, calcium, and phosphorus may also be observed. [2] Neurological symptoms like tremors (shivering) have also been reported in some dogs. [2]

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis of grape, raisin, and tamarind toxicosis in dogs is based on the patient's history of exposure and clinical signs. Other causes of renal failure, such as ethylene glycol ingestion or cholecalciferol toxicity, should be considered as differential diagnoses.

The clinical presentation typically includes vomiting or diarrhea within 6-12 hours of ingestion, followed by lethargy, anorexia, abdominal pain, weakness, dehydration, polydipsia, and tremors. Serum creatinine concentrations tend to rise prior to blood urea nitrogen, and elevations in serum creatinine are disproportionately higher compared to blood urea nitrogen.

Diagnostic tests recommended include a complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. These tests can help evaluate renal function and identify evidence of acute kidney injury, such as isosthenuria, proteinuria, hematuria, and crystalluria. Abdominal ultrasonography may also be useful to assess the kidneys for enlargement, hyperechoic cortices, and loss of corticomedullary differentiation.

## Treatment

The key elements of treatment for grape or raisin toxicosis in dogs include:

[1] Decontamination: Prompt induction of emesis is recommended if the ingestion occurred within the last 2-4 hours. Emetics such as apomorphine or hydrogen peroxide can be used to induce vomiting. Activated charcoal may also be administered to help absorb any remaining toxin.

[2] Supportive care: Aggressive intravenous fluid therapy is critical to maintain urine output and prevent acute kidney injury. Fluids should be administered at 1.5-2 times the maintenance rate for at least 48-72 hours. Placement of a urinary catheter can help monitor urine output.

[3] Monitoring: Close monitoring of the dog's condition is essential. This includes frequent monitoring of electrolytes, kidney values (creatinine, BUN), and urine output. Any signs of declining kidney function require continued aggressive fluid therapy.

[4] Treatment of complications: Medications may be used to stimulate urine output, control vomiting, and manage electrolyte/fluid imbalances. In severe cases, dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) may be required to support kidney function.

[5] Long-term management: If the dog survives the initial poisoning, long-term dietary changes and monitoring of kidney function are typically required. Gradual weaning off fluid therapy is done as kidney values improve.

The prognosis depends on the timing and effectiveness of decontamination, as well as the degree of kidney injury. Early and aggressive treatment improves the chances of a successful outcome.

## Prognosis

The prognosis for dogs that ingest grapes or raisins can vary based on several factors:

- Timing of treatment: Dogs that receive prompt decontamination and IV fluid therapy have a better prognosis than those that develop signs before treatment.

- Degree of kidney damage: Dogs that develop severe, anuric renal failure have a poorer prognosis than those with milder, non-oliguric kidney injury. 

- Individual response: Some dogs appear to be more susceptible to the toxic effects and develop more severe kidney damage than others, even with similar exposures.

With early decontamination and aggressive fluid therapy, the prognosis is generally good if the basement membrane of the kidneys remains intact. However, if the dog becomes anuric, the prognosis is guarded. Histological examination may show death of renal tubules, but preservation of the basement membrane, suggesting that with supportive care the tubules can regenerate and the dog may recover.

In summary, early detection and treatment are key to a better prognosis for dogs after grape ingestion. For dogs that develop more severe symptoms, especially related to kidney function, the prognosis becomes more variable. It's important for dog owners to seek veterinary care immediately if grape or raisin ingestion is suspected.

## Prevention

To prevent grape/raisin toxicosis in pets, it is important to:

[1] Identify high-risk foods and environments where grapes, raisins, and related products may be present. These include:
- Grapes (organic, commercial, homegrown)
- Raisins, Zante currants, sultanas
- Foods containing grapes or raisins (baked goods, trail mixes, cereals, etc.)
- Grape pressings from wineries

[2] Ensure these items are securely stored and inaccessible to pets. Keep grapes, raisins, and related foods out of reach and properly dispose of any leftovers.

[3] Educate all family members, including children, about the dangers of feeding grapes, raisins, and related foods to pets. Instruct them to never share these items with pets.

[4] Be vigilant and supervise pets closely, especially around times when these foods may be more prevalent, such as holidays and gatherings.

[5] If you suspect your pet has ingested grapes, raisins, or related products, contact your veterinarian or a pet poison control center immediately. Prompt treatment is crucial to prevent the development of acute kidney injury.

By following these prevention measures, pet owners can help avoid the potentially life-threatening consequences of grape/raisin toxicosis in their furry companions.

Grapes, raisins, and related products pose a serious threat to dogs, potentially causing acute kidney injury and even fatal renal failure. This report synthesizes key information on the pathogenesis, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of this toxicosis.

## Conclusion

The toxic agent in grapes and raisins is believed to be tartaric acid, which dogs are unable to effectively excrete. Ingestion can lead to rapid development of kidney failure, often within 1-3 days. Prompt decontamination and aggressive fluid therapy are critical for successful treatment, but the prognosis becomes more guarded as kidney damage progresses. 

To prevent grape/raisin toxicosis, pet owners must vigilantly keep these foods secure and inaccessible to their dogs. Educating family members and supervising pets closely, especially around high-risk times, are key prevention strategies. If ingestion is suspected, immediate veterinary care is essential to prevent life-threatening consequences.
