## Disease Overview

Persistent Primary Teeth, also known as retained deciduous teeth or persistent deciduous teeth, is a common dental issue in companion animals. This condition occurs when the primary (baby) teeth fail to fall out as the permanent (adult) teeth begin to erupt. 

Persistent primary teeth are most frequently seen in small breed dogs, such as Maltese, Yorkshire Terriers, Pomeranians, and Miniature Schnauzers. While less common, this issue can also occur in cats. The upper canine teeth are the most commonly affected, followed by the lower canines and incisors.

The failure of the primary teeth to exfoliate is often due to the permanent tooth bud being malpositioned, either rostral (maxillary canines) or lingual (mandibular canines) to the primary tooth. This prevents the normal eruption force from the permanent tooth to push out the primary tooth.

Persistent primary teeth can lead to a number of complications, including:

1. [1] Trapping of food, plaque, and tartar between the primary and permanent teeth, increasing the risk of dental disease.
2. [2] Causing trauma to surrounding soft tissues and improper contact between teeth, leading to abnormal wear and tooth weakening.
3. [3] Preventing the proper development of the tooth socket, eroding the support for the permanent tooth.
4. [1] Causing dental malocclusion and bite problems, such as lingually displaced mandibular canines impacting the hard palate.

Early extraction of the persistent primary teeth is typically recommended once the permanent teeth begin erupting, in order to allow the adult teeth to move into their proper positions. Waiting too long can result in more complex orthodontic treatment being required to realign the permanent teeth.

## Common Pathogens

Based on the provided source material, there does not appear to be any clear evidence of viral, bacterial, or other causative agents associated with Persistent Primary Teeth. The main factors contributing to persistent primary teeth seem to be:

1. Congenital absence of successors to the primary teeth [1, 5]
2. Impaction of the successor permanent teeth [1, 5] 
3. Trauma to the primary teeth leading to complications like pulp necrosis, cystic formation, and impaired development of permanent tooth buds [3]

The sources discuss how persistent primary teeth can lead to various dental issues like delayed eruption of permanent teeth, malocclusion, caries, and ankylosis [2, 3]. However, the focus is more on the clinical presentation and management of persistent primary teeth, rather than the underlying infectious agents.

The case report in source 3 describes a scenario where trauma and caries in the primary anterior teeth resulted in a periradicular cyst, but this appears to be a complication of the persistent primary teeth rather than a causative factor. Overall, the available evidence does not point to any specific pathogens driving the persistence of primary teeth.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Persistent primary teeth can present with a range of clinical symptoms and signs. Some common manifestations include:

[1] Failure of the primary tooth to exfoliate at the expected time, resulting in the tooth remaining in the dental arch beyond the normal shedding period. This can lead to delayed eruption or impaction of the underlying permanent tooth.

[2] Discoloration or excessive wear of the retained primary tooth, especially if it lacks a permanent successor. This can occur due to the tooth being subjected to prolonged chewing forces without proper replacement.

[3] Occlusal misalignment, where the bite does not fit together properly due to the absence or improper positioning of the permanent teeth. This can cause difficulties in chewing and TMJ discomfort. [3]

[4] Pathological conditions such as periodontal problems, dental caries, ankylosis (fusion of the tooth to the surrounding bone), and infraocclusion (submerging of the tooth below the level of the adjacent teeth). These can lead to pain, swelling, and infection. [1,2]

In the case report described, the 7-year-old patient presented with a painful, purulent swelling over the maxillary anterior region, caused by a peri-radicular cyst that developed due to the over-retention of carious primary teeth after trauma. This highlights how retained primary teeth can predispose to the development of inflammatory odontogenic cysts and abscesses.

## Diagnostic Methods

Persistent primary teeth can present in a variety of ways clinically. The main diagnostic approaches include:

Clinical examination: Dentists will assess the primary tooth visually and through palpation to evaluate its condition. This can identify issues like discoloration, caries, ankylosis, or infraocclusion.

Radiographic imaging: Panoramic and periapical radiographs are crucial for diagnosing persistent primary teeth. They can reveal the presence or absence of a permanent successor, the degree of root resorption, and any pathological changes like cysts or impaction. [1,2] 

Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) provides more detailed 3D imaging and can further evaluate the root morphology, position of the permanent tooth bud, and extent of any bone changes.[3]

Laboratory testing: There are no specific laboratory tests for persistent primary teeth. However, genetic testing may be warranted in cases associated with syndromes like cleidocranial dysplasia or hypodontia.[4]

In summary, the clinical presentation, radiographic findings, and potentially genetic factors all contribute to the diagnosis of persistent primary teeth. A comprehensive evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management. [1,2,3,4]

## Treatment Options

The available treatments for Persistent Primary Teeth include a range of medical, supportive, and nursing care approaches:

[1] Endodontic treatment: Root canal therapy can be used to treat persistent primary teeth with pulpal involvement, as seen in the study on using mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) for endodontic treatment of persistent primary molars [1].

[2] Extraction: If the primary tooth is severely damaged or has no permanent successor, extraction may be the best option to prevent further complications like malocclusion, as discussed in the case report on retaining primary anterior teeth with a peri-radicular cyst [3].

[3] Space maintenance: When a primary tooth is extracted, a space maintainer can be used to preserve the space for the eruption of the permanent successor, as noted in the Pocket Dentistry overview [2].

[4] Restorative care: Techniques like placing stainless steel crowns or composite restorations can help maintain the function and aesthetics of persistent primary teeth, as suggested in the case report [3].

[5] Interdisciplinary approach: Collaboration between dentists, orthodontists, and other specialists may be required to manage complex cases involving persistent primary teeth, impacted permanent successors, and associated dental anomalies [3].

[6] Preventive measures: Good oral hygiene, dietary modifications, and regular dental check-ups can help minimize the risks of caries and other complications associated with persistent primary teeth [3].

## Preventive Measures

One of the key preventive measures to address Persistent Primary Teeth is maintaining good oral hygiene and dental health habits. This includes:

[1] Regular dental check-ups and cleanings to monitor for issues like caries, periodontal disease, or impaction that could lead to primary tooth retention [4].

[2] Encouraging a healthy, crunchy diet that promotes natural chewing and exfoliation of primary teeth [11]. Avoiding a soft, refined diet that may not provide enough stimulation for primary teeth to shed naturally.

[3] Implementing good oral hygiene practices like twice-daily brushing and flossing to prevent dental caries and periodontal disease, which can contribute to primary tooth retention [11].

[4] Using fluoride products like toothpaste and mouthrinses to strengthen enamel and make primary teeth more resistant to decay [4].

[5] Monitoring the eruption and exfoliation of primary teeth, and consulting a dentist if a permanent successor does not emerge within the expected timeframe [5,6].

[6] In cases of genetic or developmental disorders associated with primary tooth retention, early intervention and regular dental care is crucial to prevent complications [25].

By addressing both the behavioral and biological factors that can lead to persistent primary teeth, these preventive strategies can help reduce the prevalence and impact of this condition.

## Differential Diagnosis

Persistent primary teeth can be associated with several conditions that may present with similar symptoms. Some key differential diagnoses include:

[1] Agenesis of permanent successor teeth: This is one of the most common reasons for persistent primary teeth, where the permanent successor tooth fails to develop. [2] Ectopic eruption of permanent successor: Improper eruption path of the permanent tooth can lead to it becoming impacted and prevent the primary tooth from exfoliating. [3] Impaction of permanent successor: Obstruction or lack of space can cause the permanent tooth to become impacted, leading to retention of the primary tooth. [4] Dental ankylosis: Fusion of the primary tooth root to the surrounding bone can prevent natural exfoliation.

Other potential causes include developmental disorders, endocrine disturbances, trauma, and certain syndromes like cleidocranial dysplasia and ectodermal dysplasia. Additionally, premature loss of primary teeth and subsequent space loss can also contribute to persistent primary teeth.
