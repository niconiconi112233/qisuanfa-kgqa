## Disease Overview

Feline corneal sequestrum is a condition unique to domestic cats where a dark, discolored area of dead corneal tissue develops on the eye. [1,2] The exact cause is unknown, but it is often associated with chronic corneal irritation or ulceration, such as from feline herpes virus infection, corneal trauma, or conformation issues like entropion. [1,2,5] 

Sequestra can range in size and depth, and are usually accompanied by corneal inflammation and blood vessel growth. [1,2] As the dead tissue persists, it can become painful and lead to further complications like infection or corneal perforation if left untreated. [1,2,5]  

Certain cat breeds like Persians, Himalayans, and Burmese appear predisposed to developing sequestra, suggesting a genetic or hereditary component. [1,2,5] However, the condition can occur in cats of any age or breed. [1,2]

## Common Pathogens

Corneal sequestrae can be caused by a variety of viral, bacterial, and other infectious agents. Some of the most common causative pathogens include:

[1] Herpes simplex virus (HSV): HSV is a major cause of corneal infections, leading to conditions like herpes keratitis that can result in corneal scarring and sequestrae.[2] Varicella-zoster virus (VZV): Reactivation of VZV, the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles, can also lead to corneal infections and sequestrae. 

[3] Staphylococcus aureus: This common bacteria can infect the cornea and contribute to the development of sequestrae.[4] Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Another frequent bacterial culprit in corneal infections, Pseudomonas can rapidly damage the cornea and increase the risk of sequestrae formation.

[5] Streptococcus pneumoniae: This bacterium is also a known cause of corneal infections that may culminate in sequestrae.

In addition to these key pathogens, other viruses, bacteria, fungi, and even protozoa can potentially infect the cornea and result in sequestrae. The specific infectious agent involved often depends on factors like contact lens use, eye injuries, underlying eye conditions, and the individual's immune status.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Cats with corneal sequestrae typically present with a distinct discoloration of the cornea, ranging from a light amber stain to a well-circumscribed black plaque [1,2]. This discoloration is due to the dead corneal tissue that has accumulated in the affected area. 

Surrounding the sequestrum, there is often associated corneal vascularization, edema, and ulceration [2,3]. Cats may exhibit ocular discomfort, with signs such as squinting, tearing, and sensitivity to light [2]. In some cases, the sequestrum can penetrate through the full thickness of the cornea, putting the cat at risk of perforation and vision loss [2].

The condition is more commonly seen in certain brachycephalic cat breeds, such as Persians, Himalayans, and Siamese, likely due to their conformation predisposing them to lagophthalmos and exposure keratopathy [2,4]. However, any cat with chronic corneal irritation from conditions like entropion, trichiasis, or feline herpesvirus infection can develop a corneal sequestrum [1,2].

Accurate assessment of the depth and extent of the sequestrum can be challenging without advanced imaging modalities, as the dense, opaque nature of the lesion can obscure the deeper corneal layers [2]. Nonetheless, a thorough ophthalmic examination and consideration of the cat's history and breed predisposition are essential for diagnosis.

## Diagnostic Methods

Corneal sequestrae are diagnosed through a combination of clinical, laboratory, and imaging techniques. [1] Clinical examination can reveal the characteristic discolored corneal lesion, often appearing as a dark brown or black plaque. [2,3] Surrounding the sequestrum, there may be signs of superficial vascularization, corneal ulceration, and inflammation. [4,5] 

Laboratory analysis of the sequestrum can provide insights into its composition. Studies have found the discoloration is likely due to the presence of melanin-like pigments, rather than iron deposition as previously thought. [4] Molecular techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have also detected the presence of feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) DNA in some corneal sequestrum samples, suggesting a potential role for viral infection in their pathogenesis. [6,7]

Imaging modalities like corneal topography and tomography are invaluable in fully characterizing corneal sequestrae. [8] Topographic maps can reveal the size, location, and degree of corneal steepening associated with the sequestrum. Tomographic techniques like optical coherence tomography (OCT) provide detailed cross-sectional views, allowing assessment of the depth of stromal involvement. [9,10] These advanced imaging tools are essential for surgical planning and monitoring treatment outcomes.

## Treatment Options

The treatment options for corneal sequestrae in cats include both medical and surgical approaches.

[1] Topical Medications: Veterinarians may prescribe topical antibiotics or anti-inflammatory medications to help manage any secondary infections and reduce inflammation in the affected area. These medications can provide relief and promote healing.

[2] Corneal Debridement: In some cases, veterinarians may perform a corneal debridement procedure to remove the necrotic corneal tissue. This can be done under general anesthesia using specialized tools.

[3] Corneal Surgery: For more severe or extensive corneal sequestrae, surgical intervention may be necessary. This typically involves a keratectomy, where the affected portion of the cornea is surgically removed. In some cases, a corneal graft or other reconstructive surgery may be required.

[4] Supportive Care: Alongside medical or surgical treatments, supportive care is important. This may include the use of an Elizabethan collar to prevent the cat from further irritating the eye, as well as close monitoring and follow-up to assess healing progress.

[5] Addressing Underlying Causes: Veterinarians will also aim to identify and address any underlying conditions that may have contributed to the development of the corneal sequestrum, such as eyelid abnormalities, chronic eye infections, or nutritional deficiencies.

The choice of treatment will depend on the severity of the corneal sequestrum, the cat's overall health, and the veterinarian's assessment of the best course of action. Strict adherence to medication regimens and close follow-up with the veterinarian are essential for successful management and resolution of this condition.

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination and environmental management strategies can help prevent the development of corneal sequestrae in cats. [1] Administering or increasing steroids before vaccination may be useful for preventing corneal graft rejection in cats susceptible to this complication. [1] However, the prophylactic use of antiviral treatments in patients with a history of herpes viral infection is not recommended, as it may actually increase the risk of corneal sequestrum formation. [1,13] 

In addition to vaccination management, environmental factors such as entropion, trichiasis, and exposure keratitis in brachycephalic breeds should be addressed to reduce chronic corneal irritation and sequestrum risk. [4,5,6] Proper tear film management, through the use of lubricating eye drops, can also help prevent corneal damage and sequestrum formation in predisposed cats. [9,10]

## Differential Diagnosis

Corneal sequestrae must be distinguished from other diseases that can cause similar clinical signs, such as corneal ulcers, corneal foreign bodies, and corneal dystrophies [1,2]. 

Corneal ulcers can lead to necrosis and pigmentation of the cornea, but they typically have an irregular, less well-defined border compared to the distinct circular shape of a sequestrum [1,2]. Corneal foreign bodies may also cause focal corneal opacities, but they are usually accompanied by an acute history of ocular irritation or trauma [1,2].

Breed-related corneal dystrophies, such as the crystalline corneal dystrophy seen in Siamese cats, can also lead to localized corneal opacities, but these tend to be more diffuse and bilateral compared to the unilateral, focal nature of corneal sequestrae [1,4].

Additionally, certain infectious agents like feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) have been associated with the development of corneal sequestrae, so ruling out an underlying viral keratitis is important [3,11,12].
