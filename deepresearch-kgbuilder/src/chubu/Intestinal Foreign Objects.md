## Disease Overview

Intestinal foreign objects are a common condition in companion animals, particularly dogs. Foreign body obstruction refers to a blockage in the digestive system caused by an object swallowed by the animal, such as toys, clothing, bones, or other inedible items [1]. These objects can become lodged in the throat, stomach, or intestines, preventing the normal passage of food and fluids. This can lead to severe complications like perforation of the digestive tract if left untreated.

Dogs and cats, especially young and playful ones, are at risk of ingesting foreign objects. Certain breeds like terriers, spaniels, and collies seem to have a higher predisposition [1,2]. Older animals may also start swallowing foreign objects due to underlying conditions like tumors, inflammatory bowel disease, or Cushing's disease [1].

Symptoms of intestinal foreign objects include vomiting, loss of appetite, lethargy, weight loss, and abdominal pain or diarrhea. The location of the obstruction affects the clinical signs, with more proximal obstructions causing more persistent vomiting and rapid dehydration [1,2]. Diagnosis is typically made through radiography, ultrasonography, or endoscopy, which can detect the presence and location of the foreign object [1,2].

Prompt treatment is crucial, as intestinal obstructions can rapidly become life-threatening. Initial conservative management with fluids and monitoring may be possible for some cases, but many require surgical intervention to remove the foreign object and address any associated damage to the digestive tract [1,2]. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the prognosis for intestinal foreign objects is generally good, though complications like perforation can worsen the outcome.

## Common Pathogens

Foreign body ingestion can lead to a variety of potential complications, including obstruction, perforation, and infection. The specific pathogens involved will depend on the type of foreign body and its location in the gastrointestinal tract.

Some common pathogens associated with foreign body ingestion include:

[1] Bacteria:
- Escherichia coli
- Klebsiella species
- Enterococcus species
- Pseudomonas aeruginosa
- Staphylococcus species

These bacteria can cause infections such as peritonitis, abscesses, and sepsis if the foreign body leads to perforation or obstruction.

[2] Viruses:
- Adenovirus
- Rotavirus
- Norovirus

Viral infections can occur if the foreign body causes inflammation or disruption of the gastrointestinal lining, leading to diarrhea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal symptoms.

[3] Fungi:
- Candida species

Fungal infections are more common in patients with underlying immunosuppression or prolonged antibiotic use, which can occur as a complication of foreign body ingestion.

In addition, the type of foreign body itself can pose specific risks. For example, button batteries can cause chemical burns and tissue necrosis, while sharp objects like bones or pins can directly perforate the gastrointestinal tract.

Prompt diagnosis and management of foreign body ingestion is important to prevent these types of complications and associated infections. Careful monitoring, endoscopic or surgical removal, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy may be necessary in some cases.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

The clinical presentation of intestinal foreign objects can vary widely depending on the type, location, and nature of the ingested object. In general, the most common symptoms include:

[1] Pain or cramping in the abdomen, especially if the object is sharp or large enough to cause obstruction or perforation. This can lead to more severe symptoms like fever, vomiting, and gastrointestinal bleeding. [1,2]

[2] Difficulty swallowing, chest pain, or a sensation of a lump in the throat if the object is lodged in the esophagus. This may also cause drooling, gagging, or coughing. [1,2]

[3] Nausea, loss of appetite, and abdominal bloating or distension, especially if the object is blocking movement through the intestines. [1,2]

[4] Constipation or diarrhea, depending on the location and nature of the obstruction. [1,2]

The specific symptoms depend greatly on the type of foreign object ingested. Sharp objects like bones or pins carry a higher risk of perforating the digestive tract, leading to severe pain, bleeding, and potential sepsis. Magnets or batteries can also cause serious tissue damage if lodged in the esophagus or intestines. [3,4]

Overall, the key is recognizing the potential for a foreign body ingestion, even in the absence of obvious symptoms, and acting quickly to evaluate and remove the object before it can cause complications.

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnostic tests play a crucial role in identifying and managing intestinal foreign objects. The clinical presentation, laboratory testing, and imaging approaches used to diagnose these foreign bodies are described below.

Clinical Presentation
Patients with intestinal foreign bodies may present with a range of symptoms depending on the location and characteristics of the object. Perforation can occur, leading to serious complications. Common symptoms include:

- Esophageal foreign bodies: Dysphagia, odynophagia, chest discomfort, pharyngeal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, hypersalivation with aspiration and coughing
- Foreign bodies distal to the gastroesophageal junction: Abdominal pain, melena (with sharp or corrosive objects), obstruction (with large objects), or toxidrome (with ruptured drug packets in body packers)
- Pediatric patients: Drooling, refusal to eat, coughing, or choking

Laboratory Testing
Laboratory tests are not typically necessary for the initial evaluation of intestinal foreign bodies, except in cases where complications are suspected. In those situations, tests like a complete blood count may be indicated to assess for infection or other systemic effects.

Imaging
Radiography is the primary imaging modality used in the initial and follow-up evaluation of intestinal foreign bodies. Plain radiographs can confirm the location, size, shape, and number of ingested objects, as well as help exclude aspiration. However, radiolucent foreign bodies like fish bones, wood, plastic, and thin metal objects may not be visible on radiographs.

If radiographs are negative but clinical suspicion remains high, further imaging with CT scanning may be warranted. CT can provide more detailed information about the location and composition of the foreign body, as well as identify any associated complications like perforation or abscess formation.

In some cases, a metal detector can be used to help localize metallic foreign bodies, particularly in pediatric patients.

Endoscopy is often required, even with negative radiographic findings, if the patient has persistent esophageal symptoms. Endoscopy allows for direct visualization and potential retrieval of the foreign object.

## Treatment Options

Most ingested foreign objects will pass through the gastrointestinal tract without complication. However, certain objects require prompt intervention to prevent serious complications such as obstruction, perforation, or bleeding.

Medication, such as glucagon, can be used to help relax the lower esophageal sphincter and allow food impactions to pass. However, this is not effective for all types of foreign bodies.[4,9] 

For objects lodged in the esophagus, endoscopic removal is typically recommended, especially for sharp or pointed objects, button batteries, and objects that have been present for more than 24 hours. Endoscopy allows direct visualization and controlled retrieval of the foreign body.[5,6]

Smooth, blunt objects that have passed into the stomach are often monitored conservatively, as long as they are less than 2.5 cm in diameter and less than 6 cm in length. These objects will typically pass through the GI tract without issue. However, endoscopic removal should be considered for larger objects or those that fail to progress.[2,4]

Sharp or long objects that reach the small intestine may require surgical intervention if they cannot be removed endoscopically. Laparoscopic or open surgery may be needed to retrieve the object and address any bowel injuries.[7]

In cases of multiple magnets or magnet-metal co-ingestion, prompt endoscopic or surgical removal is critical to prevent serious complications like volvulus, perforation, and fistula formation.[4]

Lastly, for ingested drug packets, endoscopic removal is not recommended due to the high risk of packet rupture. These cases require surgical consultation and potential operative removal.[8]

In summary, the treatment approach depends on the location, size, and type of foreign body ingested. Endoscopic removal is often the first-line option, but surgery may be required for certain high-risk objects or in the setting of complications.

## Preventive Measures

To prevent intestinal foreign objects, some key strategies include:

[1] Vaccination: Keeping pets up-to-date on routine vaccinations can help prevent infections or diseases that could lead to pica behavior and increased risk of foreign body ingestion.

[2] Isolation: Proper containment and isolation of pets, especially puppies and kittens, can limit their ability to access and ingest foreign objects around the home.

[3] Environmental management: Thoroughly pet-proofing the home by storing any small, easily ingested items out of reach can reduce the likelihood of pets swallowing foreign objects. This includes keeping trash cans covered, securing electrical cords, and removing any loose objects or toys that could pose a swallowing risk.

By implementing these preventive measures, pet owners can significantly reduce the chances of their pets ingesting intestinal foreign objects and avoid the need for costly and potentially complicated surgical interventions. Proactive steps to create a safe environment and monitor pet behavior are key to preventing this common and serious medical issue.

## Differential Diagnosis

When a patient presents with suspected foreign body ingestion, there are several other conditions that should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis:

[1] Dysphagia - Difficulty swallowing can be caused by esophageal abnormalities, motility disorders, or obstructions, and may be mistaken for a foreign body. [2]

[2] Esophageal cancer - Tumors in the esophagus can cause pain, difficulty swallowing, and the sensation of a lump, similar to an impacted foreign body. [3] 

[3] Esophageal rupture - Perforation or tearing of the esophageal wall can lead to chest pain, difficulty swallowing, and mediastinal complications. [4]

[4] Esophageal stricture - Narrowing or tightening of the esophagus, often due to scar tissue, can trap food and mimic a foreign body. [5]

[5] Failure to thrive - In children, chronic esophageal foreign bodies may present with poor growth and development rather than acute symptoms. [6]

[6] Intestinal perforation - Sharp or pointed foreign bodies can penetrate the bowel wall, leading to peritonitis, abscess, or sepsis. [7]

[7] Mediastinitis - Inflammation of the mediastinal tissues, often due to esophageal perforation, can cause chest pain and fever. [8]

[8] Trachea foreign bodies - Aspiration of an object into the airway can cause wheezing, coughing, and respiratory distress. [9]
