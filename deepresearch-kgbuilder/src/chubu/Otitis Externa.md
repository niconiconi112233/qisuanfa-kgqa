## Disease Overview

Otitis externa is an infection of the outer ear canal, often referred to as "swimmer's ear". It is a common condition that can be caused by both bacterial and fungal infections. 

The key points about otitis externa are:

[1] It is typically caused by bacterial infections, most commonly Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Fungal infections, though less common, can also cause otitis externa.

[2] Risk factors include excessive moisture in the ear canal (e.g. from swimming, frequent bathing), skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis, and trauma to the ear canal (e.g. from cotton swabs, hearing aids).

[3] Symptoms include ear pain, itchiness, discharge, and hearing loss if the canal becomes swollen shut. Tenderness with movement of the outer ear is a classic sign.

[4] Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on symptoms and examination findings. Cultures may be done but are not always necessary.

[5] Treatment typically involves thorough cleaning of the ear canal, followed by topical antimicrobial (antibiotic or antifungal) drops, sometimes with added corticosteroids. Oral antibiotics are reserved for severe cases or those with spread beyond the ear canal.

[6] Prevention focuses on keeping the ear canal dry, avoiding trauma, and promptly treating any underlying skin conditions.

In summary, otitis externa is a common infection of the outer ear canal that is usually straightforward to diagnose and treat with topical antimicrobial therapy, but can become more serious if left unchecked. Proper prevention and early intervention are key.

## Common Pathogens

The most common pathogens that cause otitis externa are bacterial infections, with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Staphylococcus aureus* being the most frequent culprits.[1] Otitis externa can also be caused by fungal infections, such as *Candida* and *Aspergillus* species, though these are less common.[2] In some cases, a combination of bacterial and fungal infections may occur.[2]

Predisposing factors that can increase the risk of otitis externa include water exposure (especially swimming), skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis, use of hearing aids or earbuds, and attempts to clean the ear canal with cotton swabs or other objects.[1,2] These factors can disrupt the protective barrier of the ear canal, allowing pathogens to proliferate and cause infection.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Otitis externa is a clinical diagnosis based on the characteristic symptoms and physical examination findings. The primary symptom is severe pain (otalgia) in the affected ear, which is often disproportionate to the visual findings. This pain is typically worsened by movement of the pinna or tragus. [1,2] Other common symptoms include:

- Itchiness in the ear canal
- Sensation of fullness or plugging in the ear
- Hearing loss, often conductive in nature due to swelling in the ear canal
- Otorrhea (discharge from the ear)
- Fever in more severe cases

On physical examination, the clinician will typically find erythema, edema, and narrowing of the external auditory canal. [1,2] The tympanic membrane may be partially obscured by swelling and debris. Tenderness with manipulation of the tragus or pinna is a hallmark finding. [1] 

Otitis externa can be classified by severity as mild (with just erythema and edema), moderate (with partial occlusion of the canal), or severe (with complete occlusion of the canal, intense pain, and potential spread of infection). [1]

## Diagnostic Methods

Otitis externa is primarily a clinical diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Key aspects of the diagnostic approach include:

[1] History and symptoms: Patients typically present with rapid onset of ear pain, itchiness, swelling, and discharge from the affected ear canal. Clinicians should inquire about recent water exposure, prior ear trauma or infections, and any underlying skin conditions.

[2] Physical examination: Otoscopic examination is crucial to assess the ear canal and tympanic membrane. Findings may include erythema, edema, and accumulation of debris or purulent discharge in the canal. Manipulation of the pinna or tragus usually elicits significant pain.

[3] Diagnostic tests:
- Cultures are generally not required for uncomplicated cases, as most otitis externa is caused by bacterial infections with Pseudomonas or Staphylococcus. 
- Cultures may be considered for recurrent or resistant cases, or in immunocompromised patients.
- Blood tests such as glucose or HIV testing can be considered if there is suspicion of an underlying condition predisposing the patient to otitis externa.

[4] Imaging:
- Imaging studies are not routinely needed for typical cases of otitis externa.
- Imaging with CT or MRI may be warranted if there are concerns about malignant (necrotizing) otitis externa, which can involve extension beyond the ear canal.

Overall, the diagnosis of otitis externa relies primarily on the clinical presentation and physical exam findings. Laboratory testing and imaging are reserved for more complex or atypical cases.

## Treatment Options

The mainstay of uncomplicated otitis externa treatment usually involves topical antibiotic drops and pain control. [1,2] Topical antibiotic and steroid combinations have shown high success rates, with cure rates of 87-97%. [8] Common topical antibiotics include polymyxin B, neomycin, and hydrocortisone; ofloxacin; and ciprofloxacin with hydrocortisone. [2,9] 

In cases of severe swelling, an ear wick may be used to facilitate delivery of topical medications. [2] Oral antibiotics are generally reserved for more severe cases, such as in immunocompromised patients or when the infection is unresponsive to topical treatment. [2,6] Antifungal agents may be used if a fungal infection is suspected. [10]

Pain can be managed with over-the-counter acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Opioid pain medications may be needed for severe pain. [2]

Supportive care includes keeping the ear dry, as water exposure can worsen the condition. [2] Patients are advised to avoid swimming and activities that can expose the ear to water until the infection resolves.

## Preventive Measures

Preventing otitis externa involves avoiding the key risk factors that can disrupt the natural defenses of the external auditory canal. The primary preventive approaches are:

1. Minimizing moisture exposure: Drying the ears thoroughly after swimming, bathing, or showering is crucial.[1] Using a hair dryer on the low setting can help ensure the ears are completely dry.[1] Avoiding submersing the head in water, if possible, can also reduce the risk.

2. Avoiding trauma to the ear canal: Inserting objects like cotton swabs, fingernails, or hearing aids can damage the protective cerumen layer and increase the risk of infection.[1] Patients should be advised to avoid manipulating the ear canal.

3. Managing underlying skin conditions: Chronic skin diseases like eczema, psoriasis, and seborrheic dermatitis can predispose patients to otitis externa.[1] Properly treating these conditions can help prevent recurrent infections.

4. Considering preventive ear drops: For patients at high risk, such as frequent swimmers, prophylactic use of acidifying ear drops containing 2% acetic acid and hydrocortisone can help maintain the proper pH and reduce inflammation in the ear canal.[1]

By addressing these key risk factors, healthcare providers can help patients prevent the development of otitis externa and reduce the risk of recurrent infections. Educating patients on proper ear care and hygiene is an important part of this preventive approach.

## Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for otitis externa includes several other conditions that can present with similar symptoms:

[Otitis Media](994656-overview)
Otitis media involves inflammation of the middle ear space and can sometimes lead to perforation of the tympanic membrane and drainage. It is important to distinguish otitis externa from otitis media, as the treatment approaches differ.

[Furuncle](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556055/#_article-26422_s9_)
A furuncle is a localized bacterial infection of a hair follicle, typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus. It appears as a painful, erythematous nodule in the ear canal.

[Malignant Otitis Externa](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556055/#_article-26422_s11_) 
Malignant or necrotizing otitis externa is a life-threatening infection that spreads from the external auditory canal to the temporal bone, often in immunocompromised patients. It requires emergent treatment.

[Herpes Zoster Oticus (Ramsay Hunt Syndrome)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556055/#_article-26422_s9_)
This condition is caused by varicella-zoster virus and presents with ear pain, facial paralysis, and a vesicular rash on the pinna and in the ear canal.

[Contact Dermatitis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556055/#_article-26422_s9_) 
Allergic contact dermatitis can occur in response to topical medications or materials such as earrings, hearing aids, or earplugs.

[Eczema](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556055/#_article-26422_s9_)
Chronic eczematous changes in the ear canal can mimic otitis externa.

[Cerumen Impaction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556055/#_article-26422_s9_)
Buildup of cerumen in the ear canal can cause symptoms similar to otitis externa.

[Osteomas and Exostoses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556055/#_article-26422_s9_)
These bony growths in the ear canal can predispose to recurrent otitis externa.

[Foreign Bodies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556055/#_article-26422_s9_)
Objects lodged in the ear canal can cause inflammation and infection.

Careful history, physical exam, and potentially diagnostic tests are important to differentiate otitis externa from these other conditions and guide appropriate treatment.
