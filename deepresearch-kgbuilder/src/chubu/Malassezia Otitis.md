## Disease Overview

Malassezia otitis is a common condition in dogs, characterized by moderate pruritus, inflammation, and excessive cerumen production in the ear canal. Malassezia is considered a "secondary" cause of otitis externa, as predisposing or primary factors are required for it to develop. The most common primary causes are canine atopic dermatitis and food hypersensitivity. [1]

Malassezia is the second most frequently recovered organism from canine ear cultures, after Staphylococcus. M. pachydermatis accounts for 98% of Malassezia infections in dogs, with the remaining 2% due to other Malassezia species. [1] Malassezia is also common in cats, but less so than in dogs. [2]

Malassezia otitis is typically associated with variable degrees of inflammation and excessive, malodorous, mostly brown to dark-brown, waxy discharge. However, the number of Malassezia organisms present does not always correlate with the severity of clinical signs. [3]

Malassezia is an opportunistic organism, requiring predisposing factors such as allergic dermatitis, endocrine diseases, or anatomical abnormalities that create a favorable environment for its overgrowth. Factors like high humidity, narrow ear canals, and increased cerumen production can also contribute to Malassezia otitis. [1,3]

## Common Pathogens

Malassezia species are a common secondary cause of otitis externa in dogs and cats. Malassezia is a yeast that normally lives in the ears of these animals but can overgrow when the environment of the ear canal changes, such as from increased fatty secretions and moisture.

The most commonly isolated Malassezia species is M. pachydermatis, which accounts for 98% of Malassezia organisms recovered from dog ears. M. globosus and other species make up the remaining 2%. 

Malassezia otitis is typically associated with moderate pruritus, inflammation, and cerumen (earwax) formation in the ear canal. However, Malassezia is considered a "secondary" cause of otitis externa, meaning an underlying or primary cause is required for it to develop, such as allergies or food hypersensitivity. Other predisposing factors include pendulous pinnae (ears), narrow ear canals, and high humidity.

Diagnosis of Malassezia otitis is straightforward - cytology of ear exudate should show an increased number of yeast organisms. The challenge is identifying the underlying primary cause, which could be conditions like atopic dermatitis or food allergy. Addressing the primary cause is key to successfully managing recurrent Malassezia otitis.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Malassezia otitis typically results in variable degrees of inflammation and excessive, malodorous, mostly brown to dark-brown, waxy discharge in the ear canal. *Malassezia* organisms can increase hyperplasia and secretion through the proteins and enzymes they produce, and may also trigger an immune response, resulting in severe inflammation and potentially hypersensitive reaction [1,2].

The diagnostic test of choice to confirm *Malassezia* infection is cytology. Microscopic examination of ear samples will show the characteristic round to oval "peanut-shaped" *Malassezia* yeast cells, often in clusters or adhered to skin cells [1,3]. There is no strict threshold for the number of organisms required for diagnosis, as normal colonization levels can vary, but some studies suggest that greater than 2 organisms per high-power field or 10 organisms in 15 oil-immersion fields is diagnostic [1,3,4].

In addition to the cytological findings, clinical signs of *Malassezia* otitis may include pruritus, erythema, and cerumen production. The condition is often chronic and relapsing, and may occur concurrently with other dermatological conditions like allergic dermatitis [1,2].

## Diagnostic Methods

The diagnosis of Malassezia otitis involves several key steps:

[1] Cytology is the most important diagnostic test. Cytological examination of ear samples can identify the presence and quantity of Malassezia yeast. In dogs with Malassezia otitis, the cytology typically shows an increased number of Malassezia organisms, often with a characteristic "bowling pin" or "peanut" shape. [1,2]

[2] Culture is generally not necessary for diagnosis, as Malassezia is difficult to culture and the results may not accurately reflect the clinical significance. However, culture can be useful in some cases, particularly when the organisms have an unusual morphology or in recurrent/resistant infections. [1,3]

[3] Biopsy can reveal histological changes associated with Malassezia otitis, such as parakeratosis, superficial perivascular to interstitial dermatitis, and prominent exocytosis of lymphocytes. However, biopsies are not routinely required for diagnosis. [1,4]

[4] Intradermal allergy testing for Malassezia antigen can indicate hypersensitivity in some dogs with Malassezia otitis, but this is not used to make the initial diagnosis. [1] 

[5] The diagnosis is ultimately made based on the clinical signs, cytological findings, and response to antifungal therapy. Any dog presenting with Malassezia otitis should also be evaluated for underlying primary causes, such as allergies, endocrine disorders, or conformation issues. [1,3]

## Treatment Options

Malassezia Otitis

Uncomplicated Malassezia overgrowth can usually be controlled by regular at-home ear cleaning (e.g. Epiotic Advanced). For more severe and chronic cases, a topical product containing antifungal medication (e.g. TrizUltra+Keto Flush) can be used. Initially, the ear flush is performed daily until the yeast infection is under control (1-3 weeks), followed by once weekly for maintenance. If significant concurrent inflammation is present, dexamethasone SP can be added to TrizUltra+Keto Flush. However, Malassezia otitis will relapse after the treatment is stopped unless underlying causes are addressed.

Bacterial Otitis Externa

Bacterial ear infections are considered secondary problems, so if they are recurring, the patient should be thoroughly investigated for primary underlying diseases, such as allergies. Cytology is the most effective diagnostic tool for identifying and quantitatively assessing bacteria. Numerous commercially available ear products contain antibiotics or disinfectants with antibacterial activity. Common antibiotics used include aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, polymyxins, fusidic acid, and florfenicol.

To enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics, chelating agents such as Tris-EDTA can be added. These agents weaken the bacterial cell wall and facilitate penetration of the antibiotic. Biofilm formation by bacteria, especially Pseudomonas, can complicate treatment, so thorough flushing and disruption of the biofilm is important.

Systemic antimicrobial therapy is generally discouraged for otitis externa, as topical therapy can achieve high local concentrations. However, systemic treatment may be indicated for severe cases, otitis media, or when the ear canal cannot be treated topically.

## Preventive Measures

To prevent Malassezia otitis, several key strategies can be implemented:

[1] Proper ear care and cleaning: Regular cleaning of the dog's ears using veterinary-approved ear cleaning solutions can help maintain a healthy ear environment and prevent yeast overgrowth. This is especially important for dogs prone to ear infections or those with predisposing factors like pendulous ears or excess ear hair.

[2] Addressing underlying conditions: Any dog with Malassezia otitis should be evaluated for primary conditions like food allergies or atopic dermatitis. Treating the underlying cause is crucial to prevent recurrent infections.

[3] Environmental management: Controlling factors that create a favorable environment for Malassezia, such as high humidity or moisture, can help reduce the risk of otitis. Ensuring proper drying of the ears after bathing or swimming is important.

[4] Vaccination consideration: While no specific Malassezia vaccine is available, some studies suggest that canine atopic dermatitis vaccines may help reduce the severity and recurrence of Malassezia-related otitis by modulating the immune response.[1,2]

[5] Dietary modifications: Providing a diet rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids may help improve skin and ear health, making the environment less favorable for Malassezia proliferation.[3]

By implementing these preventive measures, veterinarians can help reduce the incidence and recurrence of Malassezia otitis in canine patients.

## Differential Diagnosis

Malassezia otitis is often associated with underlying conditions like food allergy and atopic dermatitis. Other diseases that can present with similar symptoms and should be differentiated from Malassezia otitis include:

[1] Bacterial otitis externa - Caused by bacteria like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. Often presents with pain, inflammation, ulceration, hemorrhage and purulent discharge. [1,4]

[2] Otodectic mange - Caused by the mite Otodectes cynotis. Can lead to pruritus, erythema and exudative otitis. Common in young dogs and cats. [2]

[3] Allergic otitis - Associated with atopic dermatitis or food allergy. Causes erythema, pruritus and ceruminous discharge. [1,2]

[4] Neoplasia - Polyps, tumors or inflammatory masses in the ear canal can cause unilateral otitis. [2]

[5] Foreign bodies - Can lead to acute-onset unilateral otitis with pain and inflammation. [2]

The key differentiating factors are the clinical presentation, cytology/culture findings, and the presence of underlying conditions. Careful evaluation is required to rule out these other causes and identify the primary, predisposing and perpetuating factors in each case of Malassezia otitis.

# Malassezia Otitis

Malassezia otitis is a common condition in dogs, characterized by moderate pruritus, inflammation, and excessive cerumen production in the ear canal. This report examines the epidemiology, clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods, and treatment options for this fungal infection. Key findings include the role of predisposing factors like allergies and the importance of cytology for diagnosis. Treatment involves topical antifungals, with long-term management focused on addressing underlying causes. Preventive strategies such as proper ear care and controlling environmental factors can help reduce recurrence.

## References

Malassezia is the second most frequently recovered organism from canine ear cultures, after Staphylococcus. Cytological examination is the most important diagnostic test, revealing the characteristic "peanut-shaped" yeast cells. Topical antifungal therapy is typically effective, but long-term management requires addressing primary conditions like allergies:

| Diagnostic Approach | Key Findings |
| --- | --- |
| Cytology | Increased Malassezia organisms, often in clusters |
| Culture | Generally not necessary, but useful for resistant cases |
| Treatment | Topical antifungals, with management of underlying causes |
| Prevention | Proper ear care, controlling environment, addressing predisposing factors |

Moving forward, further research is needed to better understand the complex interactions between Malassezia and the canine immune system, as well as the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Veterinarians should remain vigilant in identifying and addressing the root causes of this recurrent and frustrating condition.
