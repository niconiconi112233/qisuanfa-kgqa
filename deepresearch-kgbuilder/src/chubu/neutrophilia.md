## Disease Overview

Neutrophilia is a condition characterized by an abnormally high number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, in the bloodstream. Neutrophils play a crucial role in the body's immune response, fighting off infections and aiding in the healing process.

Neutrophilia can have a variety of underlying causes, which can be classified as primary (due to inherent factors) or secondary (due to external factors). Primary causes include myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as chronic myeloid leukemia, and genetic/inherited conditions. Secondary causes are more common and can result from infections, inflammation, certain medications, and non-hematological cancers. [1]

Epidemiologically, predicting which patients are at risk of developing neutrophilia is challenging due to the multifactorial nature of the condition. Certain lifestyle factors like smoking, stress, and exercise can influence neutrophil levels. Additionally, there are some ethnic differences, with the Latino population generally having higher leukocyte and neutrophil counts compared to the white population. [2]

In summary, neutrophilia is a condition characterized by an elevated neutrophil count, which can signal underlying infectious, inflammatory, or malignant processes. Understanding the epidemiology and potential causes is crucial for appropriate diagnosis and management.

## Common Pathogens

Neutrophilia, or an increased number of neutrophils, can be caused by various viral and bacterial infections in companion animals. Some of the common viral and bacterial causes include:

[1] Viral infections:
- Canine parvovirus in dogs [1]
- Feline panleukopenia virus (feline parvovirus) in cats [1] 
- Canine distemper virus (acute phase) in dogs [1]
- Feline leukemia virus in cats [1]

[2] Bacterial infections:
- Bacterial infections leading to inflammation and tissue damage, which can stimulate the release of neutrophils from the bone marrow [1,2,7]
- Tick-borne bacterial infections such as ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis in dogs, which can cause neutrophils to contain infectious agents like morulae [4,8]
- Hepatozoonosis in dogs, where the protozoan parasite Hepatozoon americanum can be found within neutrophils [4]

The viral infections often cause a transient neutropenia initially, followed by a neutrophilia as the body responds to the infection. Bacterial infections typically result in a sustained neutrophilia, sometimes with a left shift indicating release of immature neutrophils from the bone marrow. Recognizing these infectious agents within neutrophils can help clinicians make an immediate diagnosis in some cases.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Neutrophilia itself typically does not cause specific symptoms, but rather reflects an underlying condition.[1] The clinical presentation of neutrophilia can vary widely depending on the underlying cause. 

Neutrophilia is often associated with infections, particularly bacterial infections. In these cases, patients may present with fever, chills, swelling, redness, and other signs of infection.[3] A left shift, with increased numbers of immature neutrophils (band forms), toxic granulations, and Döhle bodies may be seen on the peripheral blood smear.[1]

In chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, neutrophilia can occur without clear infectious symptoms. Patients may instead experience joint pain, fatigue, and other non-specific inflammatory symptoms.[1] 

Neutrophilia can also occur in malignant conditions like leukemia or solid tumors. In these cases, patients may report symptoms like unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and other signs of an underlying cancer.[2] 

Overall, the clinical presentation of neutrophilia depends entirely on the root cause. A thorough history, physical exam, and appropriate diagnostic testing are crucial to uncover the underlying etiology and guide management.

## Diagnostic Methods

Determining the underlying cause of neutrophilia typically involves a step-wise approach that includes the following diagnostic methods:

Complete blood count (CBC) and peripheral blood smear review: The initial evaluation should include a CBC with differential to confirm neutrophilia and review the peripheral blood smear to assess the morphology and maturity of neutrophils. This can help differentiate between reactive neutrophilia, infections, and myeloproliferative disorders.[1]

Other laboratory studies: Depending on the suspected cause, additional tests may be ordered, such as:
- Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate: To evaluate bone marrow function and identify underlying hematological disorders.[1]
- Flow cytometry: To characterize cell populations and identify genetic abnormalities associated with myeloid neoplasms.[1] 
- Molecular/genetic testing: To detect specific genetic mutations linked to myeloid disorders.[1]

Imaging: Radiological imaging such as chest X-ray, CT scan, or PET scan may be performed to assess for infections, solid tumors, or other sources of inflammation.[1]

By combining the clinical history, physical exam findings, and results from these diagnostic tests, healthcare providers can often identify the underlying cause of neutrophilia and initiate appropriate treatment. Referral to a hematologist may be warranted in cases where a myeloid neoplasm is suspected.[1]

## Treatment Options

Neutrophilia seen in infection/inflammatory state resolves with treatment of these states. Neutrophilia associated with medications can also resolve once either treatment is over or the drug is discontinued. [1]

Medications noted to cause neutrophilia should be carefully monitored and may need to be discontinued if leading to complications. [1] Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) associated with neutrophilia are usually treated with cytoreductive drugs, commonly hydroxyurea, with serial monitoring of the complete blood count (CBC). [1] For chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), specific treatment options include tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy with imatinib, which inhibits the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). [1,2]

In cases of leukemoid reaction where the white blood cell count is very high (>50,000 cells/μL), emergency interventions may be needed, such as leukopheresis, aggressive hydration, and cytotoxic therapy with hydroxyurea to prevent hypercoagulability-associated complications. [1]

For neutrophilia associated with infection or inflammation, antibiotic and anti-inflammatory therapies should be initiated. [1] Referral to a hematologist is recommended as part of the workup for MPNs. [1]

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is an important preventive measure for individuals with neutrophilia. Inactivated vaccines, which use killed or weakened forms of viruses or bacteria, are generally considered safe for those with impaired immune systems, including those with neutrophilia.[1] These vaccines can help protect against a variety of infectious diseases that may exacerbate neutrophilia. 

In addition to vaccination, environmental management strategies are also recommended. Avoiding crowds, sick individuals, and recently vaccinated people can help reduce exposure to infectious agents that could trigger an inflammatory response and worsen neutrophilia.[2] Maintaining good hygiene, such as frequent handwashing, can also lower the risk of infections.

For individuals with neutrophilia due to underlying conditions like autoimmune disorders or cancer, working closely with healthcare providers to manage the root cause is essential. This may involve medications, dietary changes, or other targeted therapies to control inflammation and regulate immune function.[3]

## Differential Diagnosis

Other conditions that can present with similar symptoms to neutrophilia include:

[1] Chronic idiopathic leukocytosis: Some individuals may have persistently elevated neutrophil counts without an underlying cause, known as chronic idiopathic leukocytosis. This is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out other potential causes. [7]

[2] Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs): Conditions like chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and polycythemia vera (PV) can present with neutrophilia. [8][9] 

[3] Genetic/inherited neutrophilia: Rare disorders like leukocyte adhesion factor deficiency, transient myeloproliferative disorder in Down syndrome, and hereditary chronic neutrophilia can lead to elevated neutrophil counts. [10][11][12]

[4] Leukemoid reaction: An extreme increase in white blood cells, including neutrophils, can occur due to infections, medications, or non-hematological malignancies. This must be distinguished from acute leukemia. [13][14][15]

[5] Nonhematological malignancies: Solid tumors can sometimes trigger a paraneoplastic leukemoid reaction, leading to neutrophilia. [15]

Careful evaluation of the patient's history, physical exam, and laboratory findings is crucial to identify the underlying cause of neutrophilia and differentiate it from these other potential conditions.
