## Disease Overview

Claw loss, also known as onychomadesis, is a condition that affects the claws (nails) of companion animals. It can have various underlying causes, both local and systemic in nature. 

The key points about claw loss are:

- It is a relatively rare condition in dogs and cats, affecting around 1-2% of these pets.
- The most common cause is trauma, which typically only affects a single claw. 
- When multiple claws are affected, it may indicate an underlying systemic disease such as:
  - Bacterial or fungal infections
  - Immune-mediated diseases like symmetric lupoid onychodystrophy (SLO)
  - Parasitic infestations (e.g. demodicosis, hookworms)
  - Nutritional deficiencies
  - Neoplasia (tumors)
- A thorough history, physical exam, and diagnostic testing are required to determine the underlying cause.
- Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but may involve antimicrobials, immunosuppressants, nail trimming/removal, and addressing any systemic conditions.
- Prognosis varies based on the cause, but can range from excellent (trauma) to poor (malignant neoplasia).

## Common Pathogens

Viral and bacterial infections, as well as other relevant pathogens, can cause claw loss in dogs and cats. Some key points:

[1] Lupoid onychodystrophy is the most common inflammatory disease causing claw abnormalities. The cause is unknown, but it is believed to be a hereditary, inflammatory, or immune-mediated condition. [1]

[2] The disease has an acute onset with loss of one or several claw plates, followed rapidly by shedding of most or all other claw plates. The pathogenesis is not fully understood, but allergic, infectious, or immune-mediated diseases may all be able to cause this disease. [2]

[3] Bacterial infections of the claw and claw bed are common and can present as paronychia. These infections are often secondary to an underlying cause like trauma. Regional lymphadenopathy, fever, and depression can occur when multiple claws are affected. Osteomyelitis is common in chronic claw bed bacterial infections. [6,8]

[4] Fungal infections of the claws, including onychomycosis, can present as onychomalacia and/or trachyonychia. Reported fungal causes include Trichophyton spp, blastomycosis, cryptococcosis, Geotrichum candidum, and Sporothrix schenckii. [4]

[5] Parasitic infections like demodicosis and leishmaniasis can also cause claw abnormalities, leading to conditions like onychogryphosis. [3,4]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

The typical symptoms of symmetrical lupoid onychodystrophy (SLO) are an acute onset of claw loss. Initially, one or two claws are lost, but over the course of a few weeks to several months, most or all claws will eventually slough off [1,2]. This is typically accompanied by severe pain and lameness, with the affected dog often seen licking or favoring the affected paws [1,2]. 

Secondary bacterial infections are relatively common in these cases [1]. As the claws regrow, they are usually misshapen, soft, brittle, crumbling, and may be discolored [1,2]. Certain dog breeds like German Shepherds, Gordon Setters, English Setters, and Finnish Bearded Collies appear predisposed to developing SLO [1,2].

## Diagnostic Methods

Examination of the clinical presentation and laboratory testing approaches are important in diagnosing claw loss.

The clinical signs of claw loss can include one or more of the following: onycholysis (detachment of the claw plate from the claw bed), onychorrhexis (fragmentation of the distal claw plate), onychoschizia (splitting of claw plate starting distally), onychomadesis (sloughing of claws), and purulent exudate associated with areas of claw splitting and paronychia.[1]

Diagnostic approaches include:

- Obtaining a detailed history, including the onset and pattern of claw loss, as well as any underlying medical conditions or recent events that may have triggered the claw loss. Certain breeds like German Shepherds, Schnauzers, and Setters are predisposed to symmetric lupoid onychodystrophy (SLO).[1] 

- Performing a thorough physical examination, looking for signs of inflammation, infection, or other abnormalities in the claw and surrounding tissue.

- Conducting laboratory tests such as a complete blood count, serum chemistry panel, urinalysis, and possibly tests for autoimmune or infectious diseases depending on the suspected cause. [1,2]

- Obtaining cytology samples from the claw bed to check for evidence of bacterial or fungal infection.

- Considering a skin biopsy or full-thickness claw biopsy (amputation of the third phalanx) in cases where the underlying cause is unclear, to allow for histopathological evaluation. This can help distinguish conditions like SLO, pemphigus, and neoplasia.[1,2]

In summary, a multi-modal diagnostic approach involving history, clinical examination, and targeted laboratory testing is essential to determine the underlying cause of claw loss and guide appropriate treatment.

## Treatment Options

The most common treatment options for claw loss include:

[1] Antibiotic therapy - Systemic antibiotics are often used to prevent or treat secondary bacterial infections, especially in chronic or recurrent cases. Empiric antibiotic selection may be necessary initially, then adjusted based on culture/sensitivity results.

[2] Supportive care - Topical treatments like chlorhexidine or dilute bleach soaks can help clean and disinfect the affected area. Pain medication may also be needed.

[3] Surgical treatment - In severe cases, removal of the damaged or affected claw(s) (onychectomy) may be required, especially if there is underlying osteomyelitis.

[4] Immunosuppressive therapy - For immune-mediated causes like symmetric lupoid onychodystrophy (SLO), long-term immunosuppressive drugs like tetracyclines, niacinamide, pentoxifylline, or glucocorticoids may be used to control the condition.

[5] Addressing underlying causes - If the claw loss is secondary to a systemic disease like hypothyroidism or Cushing's disease, treating the primary condition is important.

[6] Nutritional support - Supplementation with fatty acids or biotin may be beneficial in some cases of claw disorders.

The prognosis depends on the underlying cause, with excellent outcomes for traumatic or infectious causes, but more guarded prognosis for immune-mediated or neoplastic diseases. Close monitoring and a multi-modal approach is often needed for the best outcome.

## Preventive Measures

To reduce the impact of claw disorders and prevent lameness in dairy cattle, a combination of the following preventive measures should be implemented:

[1] Regular hoof trimming: Correctly trimming a cow's feet can give the claw stability and enable the cow to distribute weight equally across the claw. It is recommended to trim feet at least once to twice a year. [1,2]

[2] Proper flooring and cow comfort: Ensure clean, dry, and comfortable standing and lying surfaces for cows. Soft bedding such as sand is optimal, as it provides comfort and traction. Avoid hard, abrasive floors that can lead to excessive hoof wear and sole lesions. [2,3]

[3] Balanced nutrition: Formulate the ration to maintain good hoof health, considering factors like carbohydrates, protein, trace minerals, and vitamins. Proper forage and fiber levels, as well as feed particle size, are important to prevent rumen acidosis, a key contributor to laminitis. [2,4]

[4] Appropriate feeding management: Feed grain at least twice daily, providing forage before grain. Monitor dry matter and nutrient levels of the total mixed ration regularly. Gradually transition animals between diets to avoid abrupt changes. [2,4]

[5] Cow behavior and stress management: Allow cows to lie down 10-14 hours per day. Provide adequate exercise and avoid overcrowding, which can increase stress and predispose cows to lameness. Manage first-calf heifers separately to minimize laminitis risk. [2,4]

[6] Early detection and prompt treatment: Implement a lameness scoring system to identify affected animals early. Treat claw lesions promptly to prevent progression and complications. Use pain management strategies when appropriate. [1,2]

By implementing these preventive measures, dairy producers can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of lameness, improve animal welfare, and minimize the economic losses associated with claw disorders.

## Differential Diagnosis

Claw loss can have a variety of underlying causes, including trauma, infections, autoimmune diseases, and neoplasia. A thorough differential diagnosis is important to determine the root cause and guide appropriate treatment.

One of the primary considerations is symmetric lupoid onychodystrophy (SLO), which is the most common immune-mediated disease leading to symmetric claw loss in dogs [1]. SLO typically presents with an acute onset of claw loss, often affecting multiple claws across all four paws. The regrowth of claws is often abnormal, with the new claws being short, soft, brittle, and misshapen [1].

Other infectious causes to consider include bacterial infections, which can lead to paronychia, onycholysis, and onychomadesis [2]. Fungal infections, such as onychomycosis caused by Trichophyton species, can also affect the claws, though this is relatively rare in dogs and cats [2].

Neoplastic conditions, such as squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and various sarcomas, may also involve the claw and claw bed, often affecting a single digit [3]. These tumors can present with swelling, pain, and variable degrees of erosion or ulceration.

Parasitic disorders, including demodicosis and leishmaniasis, can also contribute to claw abnormalities like onychogryphosis and onychodystrophy [2].

In some cases, the claw loss may be associated with an underlying systemic disease, such as pemphigus foliaceus, lupus erythematosus, or cold agglutinin disease [2]. These conditions may present with additional cutaneous or systemic signs.

Trauma and chronic pododermatitis can also lead to claw loss or dystrophy, often affecting one or a few digits asymmetrically [2].

Overall, a thorough history, physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic tests (e.g., cytology, culture, biopsy) are necessary to determine the underlying cause of claw loss and guide the most appropriate treatment approach.

# Claw Loss

Claw loss, or onychomadesis, is a relatively rare condition in dogs and cats that can have a variety of underlying causes. This report synthesizes key information about the disease, including its common pathogens, clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, treatment options, and preventive measures. Understanding the nuances of claw loss is essential for veterinary professionals to provide effective care and minimize lameness in affected pets.

## Conclusion

Claw loss is a complex condition that requires a thorough diagnostic approach to determine the underlying cause. While trauma and infections are common triggers, immune-mediated diseases like symmetric lupoid onychodystrophy (SLO) and systemic conditions can also lead to this clinical presentation. Appropriate treatment, which may involve antibiotics, immunosuppressants, and even surgical intervention, is crucial for managing claw loss and restoring the animal's quality of life. 

Preventive measures, such as regular hoof trimming, providing proper flooring and cow comfort, and maintaining balanced nutrition, are especially important in livestock to reduce the incidence and severity of claw disorders. By implementing these strategies, veterinarians and producers can significantly improve animal welfare and minimize the economic impact of lameness.
