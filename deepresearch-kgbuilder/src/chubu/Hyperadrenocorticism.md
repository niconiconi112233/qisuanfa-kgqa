## Disease Overview

Hyperadrenocorticism, also known as Cushing's disease or Cushing's syndrome, is a condition caused by excess production of the hormone cortisol. This can be due to a tumor in the pituitary gland (pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism) or a tumor in the adrenal glands (adrenal-dependent hyperadrenocorticism) [1,2].

Pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism is the most common form, accounting for 80-90% of cases [1]. In this type, a benign tumor in the pituitary gland secretes excess adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which then stimulates the adrenal glands to overproduce cortisol. 

Adrenal-dependent hyperadrenocorticism is less common and is caused by a tumor in one or both adrenal glands. These tumors can be either benign (adenomas) or malignant (carcinomas) [1,2].

A third form, iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism, can occur from the prolonged use of glucocorticoid medications such as prednisone [1,2].

Hyperadrenocorticism typically affects middle-aged to older dogs, with certain breeds like Poodles, Dachshunds, and Boxers being predisposed [3,6]. The condition is much rarer in cats. There may also be a slight female predisposition in both dogs and cats [3,6].

## Common Pathogens

Viral and bacterial infections can activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to increased production of cortisol and potentially contributing to the development of hyperadrenocorticism.[1] Some key pathogens associated with hyperadrenocorticism include:

Viral infections: Many viral infections can induce cytokine-mediated activation of the HPA axis, resulting in elevated cortisol levels. Examples include influenza, HIV, and SARS-CoV-2 infections.[2,3] The mechanisms involve direct viral invasion of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, as well as systemic inflammatory responses.

Bacterial infections: Certain bacterial infections, such as tuberculosis and some sexually transmitted diseases, can also stimulate the HPA axis and increase cortisol production.[2] The immune response to these pathogens triggers the release of inflammatory cytokines that upregulate the HPA axis.

Other pathogens: Fungal infections like histoplasmosis and parasitic infections like malaria have also been associated with hyperadrenocorticism in some cases.[2] The mechanisms are likely similar, involving immune activation and HPA axis stimulation.

In summary, a wide range of viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections can contribute to the development of hyperadrenocorticism through their effects on the HPA axis. Awareness of these potential infectious triggers is important for the diagnosis and management of Cushing's syndrome.

Here is a draft section on the clinical symptoms and signs of hyperadrenocorticism in companion animals:

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

The common clinical symptoms and signs of hyperadrenocorticism in companion animals include:

[1] Polyuria and polydipsia: Dogs and cats with hyperadrenocorticism typically exhibit increased water consumption and urination. This is one of the most common and earliest signs of the condition.[1,2] 

[2] Polyphagia: Affected animals often exhibit an increased appetite and may beg or steal food.[1]

[3] Abdominal distension: A "pot-bellied" appearance due to fat redistribution and muscle wasting is common.[1,2] 

[4] Lethargy and exercise intolerance: Hyperadrenocorticism can lead to muscle weakness and decreased activity levels.[1]

[5] Alopecia and dermatological changes: Hair loss, thin/fragile skin, and other skin conditions are frequently observed, especially in dogs.[1,2] Cats may develop a thinning and weakening of the skin that can lead to spontaneous tearing.[2]

[6] Panting: Excessive panting is a common sign in dogs with hyperadrenocorticism.[1]

[7] Concurrent conditions: Dogs and cats with hyperadrenocorticism may also develop secondary conditions like urinary tract infections, diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, and hypertension.[1,2]

In summary, the classic clinical signs of hyperadrenocorticism in companion animals include polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, abdominal distension, lethargy, alopecia, and panting. These symptoms are often gradual in onset, making the condition easy to miss in its early stages.

## Diagnostic Methods

Hyperadrenocorticism, also known as Cushing's syndrome, is characterized by the clinical presentation of excess glucocorticoid hormones. The diagnosis can be challenging due to the wide range of clinical signs and the limitations of available diagnostic tests.

The clinical presentation of hyperadrenocorticism typically includes polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, abdominal distension, panting, muscle weakness, and dermatological changes such as thin skin, alopecia, and hyperpigmentation [1,2]. However, these signs are not specific and can occur with other conditions as well.

Laboratory testing is an important component of the diagnostic approach. Routine blood work often shows increased alkaline phosphatase activity, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and a stress leukogram [2]. Urinalysis may reveal hyposthenuria and proteinuria.

Several dynamic tests are available to confirm the diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism:

1. Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST): This test assesses the ability of the pituitary-adrenal axis to respond to negative feedback from exogenous glucocorticoids. Failure of cortisol to suppress at 8 hours post-dexamethasone administration supports the diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism. The LDDST has a reported sensitivity of 85-100% and specificity of 44-73% [2].

2. ACTH stimulation test: This test evaluates the adrenal gland's capacity to respond to ACTH. An exaggerated cortisol response is consistent with hyperadrenocorticism. The ACTH stimulation test has a sensitivity of 60-85% and specificity of 85-93% for diagnosing hyperadrenocorticism [2].

3. Urine cortisol:creatinine ratio (UCCR): This test provides an integrated measure of cortisol production over 24 hours. An elevated UCCR can indicate hyperadrenocorticism, but the test has lower specificity (20-77%) compared to the LDDST and ACTH stimulation test [2].

Once the diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism is established, further testing is needed to differentiate between pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) and adrenal-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (ADH). This can be accomplished through evaluation of endogenous ACTH levels, high-dose dexamethasone suppression testing, and advanced imaging of the adrenal glands and pituitary.

Abdominal ultrasound is a valuable tool to assess adrenal gland size and morphology. Bilateral, symmetric adrenal enlargement is typical of PDH, while a solitary adrenal mass with contralateral adrenal atrophy suggests ADH [2]. Cross-sectional imaging such as CT or MRI can provide additional detail on pituitary and adrenal pathology.

In summary, the diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism relies on a combination of clinical signs, routine laboratory testing, and specialized endocrine tests. The specific diagnostic approach should be tailored to the individual patient, taking into account the limitations and caveats of each test. Close collaboration between the clinician and the veterinary diagnostic laboratory is essential for accurate interpretation of results and reaching a definitive diagnosis.

## Treatment Options

### Trilostane

Trilostane is the treatment of choice for most cases of pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) in dogs. It is a synthetic steroid analogue that inhibits the 3Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme system, interfering with adrenal steroid biosynthesis.

The starting dose is typically 2-5 mg/kg given once daily with food. The dose can be adjusted based on the dog's response, monitored using ACTH stimulation tests. The goal is to keep the post-ACTH stimulation cortisol level below 120 nmol/L.

Trilostane is generally well-tolerated, with a lower prevalence of side effects compared to mitotane. However, it can cause reversible hypoadrenocorticism in some dogs. Careful monitoring and dose adjustments are required.

### Mitotane Therapy 

Mitotane (o,p'-DDD) is also an effective treatment for PDH. It selectively destroys the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex, reducing cortisol production.

Mitotane is given orally at 50 mg/kg/day during the initial induction phase until the desired clinical response is achieved, such as decreased water intake. Maintenance therapy is then given at 50 mg/kg weekly.

Close monitoring is essential during mitotane treatment to avoid adrenal crisis. Potential side effects include gastrointestinal upset, neurological signs, and hypoadrenocorticism.

### Other Treatments

- L-deprenyl (selegiline): A monoamine oxidase inhibitor that inhibits ACTH secretion. Around 50% of dogs respond adequately.
- Ketoconazole: A reversible inhibitor of glucocorticoid synthesis. However, it is not uniformly effective, with 30-50% of dogs failing to respond.
- Bilateral adrenalectomy: Surgical removal of the adrenal glands. Provides immediate reduction in cortisol levels but requires lifelong glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy.
- Hypophysectomy: Surgical removal of the pituitary gland. Technically difficult but can provide a high rate of long-term remission.
- Radiation therapy: Can be effective for pituitary macroadenomas, but often requires concurrent medical therapy due to residual ACTH secretion.

## Nursing Interventions

Key nursing interventions for the patient with hyperadrenocorticism include:

- Closely monitor vital signs, especially blood pressure and heart rate
- Assess fluid balance and electrolyte status (may need diuretics or fluid management)
- Monitor blood glucose levels and manage accordingly
- Encourage rest and activity as tolerated
- Assess and promote skin integrity (may be impaired due to cortisol effects)
- Provide patient education on the condition, treatment, and signs of complications
- Prepare the patient for any diagnostic tests or surgical procedures
- Administer medications as prescribed, monitoring for side effects
- Coordinate care with the multidisciplinary team

## Preventive Measures

Hyperadrenocorticism, also known as Cushing's syndrome, is a common endocrine disorder in older dogs that results from excess production of cortisol. While there are no specific preventive measures for this condition, several management strategies can help mitigate its development and progression:

Dietary Management: A controlled diet low in carbohydrates and fats may help manage weight gain and other symptoms associated with hyperadrenocorticism [6]. Reducing calorie intake and providing a balanced, nutrient-dense diet can help maintain a healthy body condition.

Environmental Management: Ensuring a calm, stress-free environment for the dog is important, as stress can exacerbate the symptoms of hyperadrenocorticism [2,3]. Providing enrichment activities, a consistent routine, and minimizing disruptions can help.

Regular Monitoring: Close monitoring of cortisol levels and overall health through regular blood tests and check-ups is crucial for effectively managing Cushing's syndrome [6]. This allows for early detection and timely intervention if necessary.

While there are no proven preventive measures for spontaneous hyperadrenocorticism, these management strategies can help mitigate the development and progression of the condition in affected dogs.

## Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating a patient for hyperadrenocorticism, it is important to consider other diseases that can present with similar clinical signs and laboratory abnormalities. Some key differential diagnoses include:

[1] Other causes of Cushing's syndrome, such as pituitary-dependent disease or adrenal carcinoma. While the majority of cases are pituitary-dependent (80-85%), adrenal-dependent hyperadrenocorticism should also be considered, especially in larger breed dogs.[2]

[3] Diseases that can cause a stress response and mimic some signs of hyperadrenocorticism, such as severe systemic illness, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or pyometra. These conditions may produce an abnormal or equivocal ACTH stimulation test result, but will usually have a normal response after the underlying disease is treated.[2]

[4] Conditions that can elevate alkaline phosphatase, a common laboratory finding in hyperadrenocorticism, including hypothyroidism, hepatopathies, and chronic kidney disease.[2] 

[5] Hyperadrenocorticism secondary to iatrogenic glucocorticoid administration, which requires a different diagnostic approach focused on identifying the source of exogenous steroids.[2]

Careful history, physical examination, and targeted diagnostic testing are important to differentiate hyperadrenocorticism from these other potential causes of the presenting clinical signs and laboratory abnormalities. A thorough workup, including imaging studies, may be necessary in some cases to confirm the diagnosis.
