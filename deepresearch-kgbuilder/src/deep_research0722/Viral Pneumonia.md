## Disease Overview and Etiology

Viral pneumonia is a significant respiratory disease affecting dogs and cats, characterized by inflammation in the deep lung tissues where oxygen absorption and gas exchange occur. In dogs, viral pneumonia is commonly caused by canine distemper virus and canine influenza virus, while in cats it often results from complicated feline upper respiratory infections [1]. The disease is particularly concerning because it has the potential to be life-threatening regardless of its cause.

Unlike bacterial pneumonia, which is frequently a secondary infection, viral pneumonia primarily begins with viral invasion of the respiratory epithelium. The virus attaches to host cells via specific receptor proteins, initiating fusion of viral and host cell membranes, which allows viral genome entry into the cell, leading to infection [2]. In most cases, viral pneumonia involves a bacterial component, as opportunistic bacteria colonize damaged lung tissue, adding their own inflammatory effects including pus, fever, and potential for serious complications [1].

The pathophysiology involves inflammation of lung tissues, causing fluid and inflammatory cell accumulation. This results in impaired gas exchange and respiratory distress. Affected animals typically present with coughing, although cats with pneumonia may cough less frequently than dogs. Other clinical signs include lethargy, fever, nasal discharge, and difficulty breathing [1]. Diagnosis hinges on chest radiographs, which show characteristic patterns of lung infiltration, though additional diagnostic testing may be needed to determine the underlying viral cause.

## Common Viral Pathogens and Transmission

Viral pneumonia in companion animals is primarily caused by several key respiratory viruses that infect the lower respiratory tract. In dogs, canine distemper virus (CDV) represents one of the most severe viral pathogens, capable of causing systemic disease with respiratory involvement that can progress to pneumonia. Canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) and parainfluenza virus are frequent contributors to the canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC), commonly known as "kennel cough," which can develop into pneumonia in severe cases [1].

Other significant viral agents include canine influenza viruses (H3N8 and H3N2), canine respiratory coronavirus, canine herpesvirus, and canine pneumovirus [2]. In felines, specific respiratory viruses include feline herpesvirus and feline calicivirus, which primarily cause upper respiratory infections but can progress to pneumonia in severe cases.

Transmission of these viruses typically occurs through aerosolized respiratory secretions when infected animals cough, sneeze, or bark. The viruses become airborne and can be inhaled by susceptible animals. Crowded environments with poor ventilation significantly increase transmission risk, particularly in boarding kennels, shelters, and veterinary hospitals [3].

Co-infections with multiple viral agents or bacterial pathogens like Bordetella bronchiseptica or Mycoplasma species often exacerbate disease severity, increasing the likelihood of progression from upper respiratory infection to viral pneumonia [1, 2].

## Clinical Signs and Presentation

Viral pneumonia in dogs and cats typically presents with distinctive respiratory signs, though manifestation can vary between species. Coughing is the hallmark symptom in dogs, often accompanied by gagging and retching. In contrast, cats with pneumonia may hardly cough at all, making diagnosis more challenging [1]. Respiratory distress, including rapid or labored breathing, may be observed as the disease progresses, especially in severe cases.

Systemic symptoms often include lethargy, decreased appetite, and fever, particularly with influenza viruses like H3N2 [2]. Nasal and ocular discharges can develop depending on the causative infectious agent. In dogs, viral pneumonia frequently begins with mild symptoms that worsen over days, with potential progression to life-threatening disease if left untreated.

The physical examination may reveal abnormal lung sounds, including pulmonary crackles when auscultated [2]. Chest radiographs typically show a mixed moderate to severe bronchointerstitial pattern [3]. Without proper treatment, the condition can deteriorate rapidly, leading to significant respiratory compromise. The disease progression depends on the viral agent, with some cases resolving within 10 days, while others may require several weeks of treatment and monitoring [1].

## Diagnostic Approaches

Diagnosing viral pneumonia in pets requires a systematic approach combining physical examination, imaging, and laboratory testing. Radiography remains the first-line diagnostic tool, although viral pneumonia may show minimal radiographic changes or present as a diffuse unstructured interstitial pattern with hazy lung opacity [1]. Unlike bacterial pneumonia which typically shows cranioventral alveolar patterns, viral pneumonia often has a more diffuse or caudodorsal distribution [1, 2].

Physical examination may reveal increased respiratory rate and effort, abnormal lung sounds, and cough, though findings can be variable. Thoracic radiography should include multiple views (right lateral, left lateral, and ventrodorsal or dorsoventral) to fully evaluate the lungs, as atelectasis in dependent lobes can obscure pathology [1].

Advanced imaging techniques include computed tomography (CT), which provides cross-sectional images free of superimposition, allowing earlier detection of subtle changes and secondary lymphadenopathy [3]. CT is particularly valuable when radiographic findings are equivocal.

Laboratory diagnostics have evolved significantly with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panels now available that detect nucleic acids of common viral respiratory pathogens [4]. These panels offer high sensitivity, cost-effectiveness, and rapid results compared to traditional culture methods. Molecular diagnostic techniques can identify specific viral pathogens even when radiographic changes are minimal, enabling targeted treatment approaches and improved patient outcomes.

## Treatment Strategies

Treatment of viral pneumonia in pets requires a comprehensive approach focusing on supportive care while addressing secondary bacterial infections. Oxygen therapy is critical for patients struggling to maintain adequate oxygenation, with severely affected animals requiring oxygen cages or supplemental oxygen to maintain levels above 94% [1]. Fluid therapy plays a crucial role, as proper hydration helps maintain respiratory secretions at appropriate viscosity, improving the mucociliary escalator function and facilitating secretion removal [2].

Antimicrobial therapy is typically necessary to address secondary bacterial infections, which commonly accompany viral pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be selected based on their ability to penetrate the blood-bronchus barrier, with fluoroquinolones and beta-lactam antibiotics often used in combination for comprehensive coverage [3]. When possible, culture and sensitivity testing should guide antibiotic selection.

Nebulization therapy is essential for mobilizing respiratory secretions. Using devices that create particles between 0.5-3.0 micrometers allows medication to reach the lower airways [4]. Saline nebulization helps moisten secretions, while coupage (gentle percussion of the chest) assists in loosening and removing them. Some veterinarians add mucolytics or bronchodilators to nebulization therapy [5].

While specific antiviral medications are limited in veterinary medicine, supportive care remains the cornerstone of treatment. This includes maintaining proper nutrition, providing supplemental heat, ensuring a stress-free environment, and in some cases, implementing bronchodilator therapy [2]. Recovery can take several weeks, with antibiotics typically continued for at least 10-14 days after clinical resolution [1,2].

## Preventive Measures

Preventing viral pneumonia in companion animals requires a comprehensive approach combining vaccination, isolation protocols, and environmental management. Regular vaccination is the cornerstone of prevention, particularly for common respiratory viruses like canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus-2, canine parainfluenza, and canine influenza viruses [1]. While vaccines may not completely prevent infection, they typically reduce disease severity and duration if breakthrough infections occur [4].

Isolation procedures are crucial when dealing with suspected or confirmed cases. Animals with respiratory symptoms should be examined in designated areas that can be easily disinfected [1]. For households with multiple pets, infected animals should be separated from healthy ones to prevent transmission. In veterinary settings, strict barrier nursing protocols should be implemented [7].

Environmental management plays a significant role in prevention. This includes proper disinfection of living spaces, kennels, and veterinary facilities with effective virucidal disinfectants. Non-enveloped viruses, which cause some types of viral pneumonia, require specific disinfectants like accelerated hydrogen peroxide or potassium peroxymonosulfate [5]. Porous items like bedding should be washed with detergent and bleach or discarded if heavily soiled [5].

Additionally, limiting exposure to potential sources of infection, such as dog parks or boarding facilities during outbreak periods, can reduce risk. For multi-pet households, maintaining current vaccinations for all animals provides herd immunity that helps protect the entire group [4].

## Differential Diagnosis

Accurate diagnosis of viral pneumonia requires careful consideration of other respiratory conditions with similar clinical presentations. Bacterial pneumonia is a common differential, often characterized by purulent nasal discharge, fever, and coughing. Unlike viral pneumonia, bacterial cases typically respond well to antibiotic therapy and may show more defined lobar patterns on radiographs. Fungal infections like aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, and histoplasmosis can mimic viral pneumonia but frequently present with more chronic symptoms and may have additional systemic manifestations [1].

Non-infectious conditions must also be considered. Aspiration pneumonia results from inhalation of vomited or regurgitated food, with a history of regurgitation often present. Pulmonary neoplasia may appear similar radiographically but typically has a more progressive course [2]. Parasitic pneumonia from lungworms or migration of other parasites produces an eosinophilic inflammation pattern distinct from viral cases [3].

In cats, bacterial bronchopneumonia is relatively uncommon compared to dogs, making viral etiologies more likely in feline patients [4]. Diagnosis often requires a combination of radiography, culture, PCR testing for specific pathogens, and possibly tracheal wash or bronchoalveolar lavage to distinguish between these conditions [5].
