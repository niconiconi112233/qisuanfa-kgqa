## Disease Overview: Obstructive Laryngitis

Obstructive laryngitis is a respiratory condition affecting companion animals that involves inflammation and narrowing of the larynx (voice box), leading to breathing difficulties. The larynx serves as a critical guardian of the airways, controlling airflow and preventing food or liquid from entering the respiratory tract. When obstructed, animals struggle to take deep breaths, which can create significant distress and anxiety.

In dogs, acute laryngitis manifests as repeated bouts of hard, dry coughing that often lead to gagging. The condition is characterized by edema (swelling) and hypervascularization of the laryngeal mucosa. Common causes include infectious tracheobronchitis ("kennel cough") in dogs, while in cats, herpesvirus and calicivirus infections may affect the laryngeal mucosa [1].

Large-breed dogs, particularly Labrador retrievers, are more commonly affected by severe forms of laryngeal obstruction such as laryngeal paralysis, which can progress to respiratory crisis if untreated. In cats, laryngeal conditions are rarer but typically present with stridorous breathing rather than coughing due to edema of the laryngeal mucosa [1, 3].

Chronic forms of laryngitis can persist for years in dogs, causing coughing during exertion or when pulling against a leash. Treatment approaches vary based on severity but often include rest, increased hydration, and avoiding triggers that stimulate coughing [3].

## Etiology and Common Pathogens

Obstructive laryngitis in pets can result from various causes that impair normal airflow through the larynx. In dogs and cats, these causes include both infectious and non-infectious factors. Common viral and bacterial pathogens involved include canine infectious tracheobronchitis agents ("kennel cough") in dogs, and herpesvirus and calicivirus in cats, which can affect the laryngeal mucosa causing inflammation and edema [1].

Non-infectious causes are equally significant. Allergic reactions, particularly insect stings or bites near the larynx, can cause severe laryngeal edema requiring immediate medical intervention [2]. Physical obstructions like laryngeal tumors may gradually impair airflow, with squamous cell carcinomas being particularly invasive [2]. Breed-specific anatomical factors also play a role, with brachycephalic dogs often suffering from congenital laryngeal hypoplasia resulting in inadequate airway development [3].

Other causes include laryngeal paralysis, which occurs commonly in older large-breed dogs due to neurogenic disease affecting the recurrent laryngeal nerves [3]. Trauma to the larynx may cause life-threatening obstruction through hemorrhage and edema [3]. Additionally, food allergies may contribute to airway inflammation in both dogs and cats, exacerbating other respiratory conditions [4].

Early identification of the underlying cause is critical for effective treatment and management of obstructive laryngitis in pets.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Obstructive laryngitis in dogs and cats presents with a characteristic set of respiratory and behavioral signs. Affected animals typically exhibit inspiratory dyspnea with prominent stridor—a loud, rasping sound during breathing that indicates partial airway obstruction. This respiratory distress is often accompanied by an extended head and neck posture as the animal attempts to maximize airflow [1,2].

Coughing patterns vary from dry, persistent coughs to paroxysmal episodes that may lead to gagging, particularly in dogs. Vocalization changes are highly indicative of laryngeal involvement, with hoarseness being common. A distinctive "breaking voice" may occur when barking or meowing begins normally but suddenly changes to a breathy sound or is lost completely [1].

Animals with obstructive laryngitis often show behavioral indicators such as anxiety, restlessness, and exercise intolerance. Symptoms typically worsen with excitement, physical exertion, or in hot, humid environments [3,4]. In severe cases, animals may display open-mouth breathing, flared nostrils, and abducted elbows to maximize respiratory effort [4,5]. Cats are particularly adept at masking disease severity, often showing only subtle signs like tachypnea or prominent respiratory movements in sternal recumbency until their condition becomes critical [5].

As the condition progresses, cyanotic mucous membranes may develop, indicating significant oxygen deprivation. Without appropriate intervention, respiratory arrest can occur, making obstructive laryngitis a potentially life-threatening condition [1,3].

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosing obstructive laryngitis requires a systematic approach combining physical examination, specialized visualization techniques, and supportive laboratory testing. During physical examination, practitioners should listen for characteristic sounds including stridor (a loud, harsh respiratory sound) which indicates laryngeal obstruction. This stridor is typically accompanied by some degree of dyspnea, with louder stridor indicating more severe obstruction [1].

Laryngoscopy is the gold standard diagnostic procedure. This involves direct visualization of the larynx under sedation, with the level carefully balanced to be deep enough for examination but light enough to observe laryngeal function. If sedation is too deep, a respiratory stimulant such as doxapram hydrochloride may be administered to induce deep breaths and observe laryngeal movement [2]. During laryngoscopy, practitioners evaluate the appearance of the laryngeal mucosa and the movement of the arytenoid cartilages during respiration.

In some cases, endoscopy through the nostril may allow visualization without sedation, though specialized equipment is required [2]. Diagnostic imaging is also valuable, with radiographs helpful for identifying foreign bodies, fractures of the hyoid bone, or cartilage calcification. For more detailed evaluation, computed tomography or MRI provides superior visualization of soft tissue structures and extent of lesions [1].

Laboratory diagnostics should include complete blood testing, including thyroid tests, to rule out underlying conditions. Electromyography of the laryngeal muscles may be utilized in cases where neurologic disorders are suspected as the underlying cause [3].

## Treatment Protocols

Treatment for obstructive laryngitis in companion animals requires a multi-faceted approach based on severity and underlying cause. For acute inflammatory cases, corticosteroids can effectively reduce laryngeal swelling and improve airflow. Anti-inflammatory medications are typically administered intravenously in severe cases to rapidly reduce edema and prevent life-threatening airway obstruction [1].

Antibiotic therapy is indicated when bacterial infection is present, particularly in cats with viral-induced laryngitis where secondary bacterial infections are common. These patients often benefit from parenteral fluid therapy alongside antibiotics to maintain hydration and support recovery [2].

Supportive care includes enforced rest, increased environmental humidity, and adequate hydration to reduce laryngeal irritation. Oral administration of water helps minimize mucosal irritation and reduces coughing episodes [3].

For cases unresponsive to medical management, surgical intervention becomes necessary. The most common procedure is laryngeal tieback (lateralization surgery), which involves suturing the arytenoid cartilage in a more open position to improve airflow. Alternative surgical options include partial arytenoidectomy, ventriculocordectomy (de-barking), and laryngeal stenting [1].

Post-operative management must include restrictions on swimming and physical activity to prevent complications. Regardless of treatment approach, careful monitoring for signs of aspiration pneumonia is essential, as it remains a significant risk in these patients [1].

## Preventive Measures and Breed Considerations

Preventing obstructive laryngitis requires a multifaceted approach, particularly for brachycephalic breeds which are inherently predisposed to respiratory issues. Breeds such as English and French Bulldogs, Pugs, Shih-Tzus, and Pekingese face significantly higher risks due to their distinctive skull conformation [1]. These dogs have normal amounts of soft tissue compressed into a shortened skeletal structure, resulting in excessive tissue that can obstruct airways.

Key preventive strategies include weight management, as obesity exacerbates respiratory difficulties. Environmental management is crucial—avoid exercising these breeds during hot weather, high humidity, or times of excitement which increase respiratory demand [3]. Consider using harnesses instead of collars to prevent additional pressure on the trachea and throat [6].

For high-risk brachycephalic dogs, early surgical intervention to correct anatomical abnormalities like stenotic nares and elongated soft palate can prevent progression to more severe conditions [2]. Without intervention, chronic breathing difficulties can lead to secondary problems, including laryngeal collapse requiring permanent tracheostomy [6].

Proper anesthetic protocols are essential when these dogs require any procedure, including pre-oxygenation before induction and careful monitoring during recovery [3]. Owners should recognize normal breathing patterns for their pets and seek veterinary attention if abnormal respiratory sounds increase in frequency or severity.

## Differential Diagnosis

When diagnosing obstructive laryngitis in dogs and cats, several respiratory conditions may present with similar clinical signs, making accurate differentiation crucial. Laryngeal paralysis is a common mimic, characterized by an inability of the arytenoid cartilages to abduct properly during inspiration. Unlike obstructive laryngitis, laryngeal paralysis typically affects older, large-breed dogs and presents with more pronounced inspiratory stridor and exercise intolerance [1].

Brachycephalic airway obstruction syndrome is another important differential, primarily affecting flat-faced breeds with anatomical abnormalities like elongated soft palate and stenotic nares. The respiratory distress in these cases tends to worsen with exercise and heat [2].

Tracheal collapse may mimic obstructive laryngitis, especially when the collapse occurs in the cervical region. The hallmark "goose honk" cough and exacerbation with excitement help distinguish this condition, which primarily affects toy breeds [3].

Other conditions to consider include foreign bodies in the larynx or trachea, neoplasia, infectious tracheobronchitis, and aspiration-related upper airway inflammation. Radiographs, endoscopy, and careful evaluation of the pattern of respiratory distress (inspiratory vs. expiratory) are critical for accurate diagnosis [4].
