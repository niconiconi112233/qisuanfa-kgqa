## Disease Overview: Tracheal Obstruction in Dogs and Cats

Tracheal obstruction refers to a partial or complete blockage of the trachea (windpipe), compromising normal airflow and respiratory function in companion animals. Anatomically, the trachea consists of C-shaped cartilage rings connected by the dorsal tracheal membrane, forming a rigid yet flexible tube that extends from the larynx to the bronchi. In normal animals, this structure maintains an open airway during all phases of respiration.

Tracheal obstruction can occur due to various causes, including tracheal collapse, hypoplastic trachea, foreign bodies, masses, or excessive mucus accumulation. The condition affects both dogs and cats, though the prevalence varies by breed and type. In dogs, tracheal collapse is most common in small breeds such as Yorkshire terriers, miniature poodles, and Pomeranians, typically affecting middle-aged to older animals. Hypoplastic trachea is particularly prevalent in brachycephalic breeds, with English Bulldogs showing the highest incidence (55%).

The normal ratio of tracheal diameter to thoracic inlet diameter ranges from 0.2 in non-brachycephalic breeds to 0.07-0.21 in bulldogs and approximately 0.16 in other brachycephalic breeds. This anatomical difference contributes to the higher susceptibility of certain breeds to airway obstruction and respiratory distress.

## Etiology and Common Causes

Tracheal obstruction in companion animals stems from various pathological conditions that restrict airflow through the trachea. Foreign bodies are a common cause, particularly in cats who may inhale small objects like pebbles that become lodged in the tracheal lumen. Tracheal collapse is prevalent in middle-aged and older small-breed dogs, resulting from weakened cartilage rings (tracheomalacia) that can no longer maintain the rigid C-shape needed for proper airflow. The collapse may occur anywhere from the mid-trachea to the stem bronchi, with extrathoracic portions typically collapsing during inspiration and intrathoracic portions during expiration [1].

Tracheal hypoplasia, characterized by an abnormally narrow tracheal diameter, is frequently observed in brachycephalic breeds with ratios of tracheal diameter to thoracic inlet diameter measuring 0.07-0.21 in bulldogs compared to 0.2 in non-brachycephalic breeds [2]. Other pathological conditions include tracheal stenosis following injury or inflammation, neoplasia (including osteochondroma, osteosarcoma, and chondrosarcoma), and external compression from enlarged structures such as the left atrium, mediastinal masses, or enlarged tracheobronchial lymph nodes [3].

Inflammatory conditions like viral tracheobronchitis can cause mucosal edema and excessive secretions that narrow the airway lumen. Secondary bacterial infections often compound these conditions, further compromising respiratory function [4].

## Clinical Signs and Presentation

Tracheal obstruction in dogs and cats presents with characteristic respiratory signs that vary depending on the severity and location of the obstruction. The most common clinical sign is a persistent, harsh, dry cough that is often described as "honking" or "goose-honk" quality in dogs [1]. This coughing is typically non-productive and may become paroxysmal (occurring in sudden, severe episodes), especially when triggered by excitement, exercise, or pressure on the trachea [2].

Respiratory distress is another key presentation, with affected animals showing increased respiratory effort, particularly during inspiration when the cervical trachea is involved. Affected pets often display tachypnea (rapid breathing), exercise intolerance, and may adopt an extended neck posture to maximize airway patency [3]. In severe cases, patients may exhibit open-mouth breathing, cyanosis (bluish discoloration of mucous membranes), and paradoxical respiration where the chest and abdomen move in opposite directions [4].

Stridorous breathing (a high-pitched, noisy sound) during inspiration is commonly heard, especially with upper airway obstructions. Upon physical examination, gentle palpation of the trachea typically elicits the characteristic cough [5]. Some animals may also present with gagging or retching, particularly after episodes of severe coughing.

As the condition progresses or in acute obstruction cases, animals can experience rapid decompensation with signs of respiratory fatigue, requiring immediate intervention [6].

## Diagnostic Approaches

Diagnosing tracheal obstruction requires a systematic approach using multiple complementary techniques. Radiography serves as the foundation, with lateral views of the laryngeal and cervical region often being sufficient for initial assessment. Both inspiratory and expiratory radiographs are essential for detecting dynamic tracheal collapse, as extrathoracic trachea typically collapses during inspiration while intrathoracic trachea collapses during expiration [1].

For small dogs with suspected tracheal collapse, dynamic radiography is valuable but requires patience. Creating a "doggie burrito" by swaddling the patient in a towel with legs pulled forward can facilitate proper positioning while minimizing stress [2]. While radiography is essential, it may underestimate the severity of tracheal collapse, making advanced diagnostics necessary in many cases.

Fluoroscopy represents the gold standard for evaluating dynamic airway changes, allowing real-time visualization of the trachea during breathing and coughing. When radiography and fluoroscopy prove inconclusive, tracheobronchoscopy becomes invaluable, enabling direct visualization of the airways and assessment of collapse severity [2].

Endoscopy also facilitates collection of diagnostic samples through bronchoalveolar lavage, cytology brushings, and biopsies. This technique can simultaneously serve therapeutic purposes, allowing for foreign body removal or intervention for obstructive masses [3]. CT scanning provides cross-sectional imaging without superimposition, offering superior detection of subtle airway abnormalities and associated pathologies [3].

## Treatment Options and Emergency Management

Tracheal obstruction in pets requires prompt and often multifaceted treatment approaches. For emergency cases presenting with severe respiratory distress, immediate intervention begins with oxygen therapy, sedation with medications like acepromazine (0.05-0.2 mg/kg) or diazepam (0.2 mg/kg), and cough suppressants such as butorphanol (0.5-1.0 mg/kg) or hydrocodone [1].

Medical management is the first-line treatment for mild to moderate cases, with approximately 71% of dogs responding to this approach alone. This includes antitussives, anti-inflammatory medications, bronchodilators, and weight management [2]. For patients with concurrent bacterial infections, appropriate antibiotics should be selected based on tracheal culture results [1].

When medical management fails, surgical options include placement of extraluminal tracheal rings or intraluminal stents. Tracheal rings are suitable for cervical tracheal collapse but carry risks including laryngeal paralysis [3]. For intrathoracic tracheal collapse, self-expanding metallic stents offer a minimally invasive alternative with improvement rates of 75-90% [3].

However, stent placement has complications, including stent fracture (19%), tissue ingrowth (17%), progressive collapse (10%), and infection (57%) [4]. Despite these risks, intraluminal stenting significantly improves quality of life with mean survival times of approximately 1000 days, though most patients require continued medication [4].

## Differential Diagnosis

When diagnosing tracheal obstruction, it's essential to consider other respiratory conditions that may present with similar symptoms. Tracheal obstruction typically manifests with inspiratory dyspnea, stridor, and coughing, but these symptoms can also indicate other respiratory disorders.

Upper airway disorders that mimic tracheal obstruction include laryngeal paralysis, laryngeal collapse, and brachycephalic syndrome. Laryngeal paralysis presents with stridor and respiratory distress, especially during exercise or in hot weather. Laryngeal collapse can be distinguished by its progressive nature and association with chronic upper airway obstruction. Brachycephalic syndrome, common in short-nosed breeds, causes similar respiratory sounds but is typically accompanied by stenotic nares and elongated soft palate [2].

Lower airway diseases may also resemble tracheal obstruction. Chronic bronchitis presents with coughing and expiratory wheeze rather than the inspiratory stridor characteristic of tracheal obstruction. Asthma in cats produces expiratory distress and wheezing, while bronchiectasis shows dilated, irregularly shaped bronchi visible on radiographs [3][4].

Other differentials include tracheal stenosis and tracheal hypoplasia. Tracheal stenosis appears as focal narrowing on imaging, whereas hypoplasia shows a uniformly small tracheal diameter throughout. Tracheal masses and foreign bodies may also cause obstruction but typically present with more acute onset of symptoms [6][7].

Careful evaluation is required, as pleural space disorders (pneumothorax, pleural effusion) and pulmonary parenchymal diseases can also cause respiratory distress that might be confused with tracheal obstruction. Diagnostic imaging, including inspiratory and expiratory radiographs, is crucial for differentiation, with fluoroscopy and tracheoscopy providing definitive diagnosis in challenging cases [3][7].

## Preventive Measures and Client Education

Prevention of tracheal obstruction requires a multifaceted approach focusing on risk reduction and early intervention. Pet owners should maintain healthy weight management for their animals, as obesity increases pressure on the trachea and exacerbates respiratory distress [3]. Environmental modifications are equally important - eliminating airborne irritants such as smoke, strong cleaning products, and dust mites can reduce respiratory inflammation and coughing episodes that may trigger obstruction [3, 6].

For pets with collapsing trachea or other predisposing conditions, owners should switch from collar to harness use to prevent pressure on the tracheal rings [6]. Recognizing early warning signs is crucial; owners should be educated about abnormal respiratory patterns, particularly inspiratory stridor, unusual respiratory noises, and exercise intolerance [8, 10].

Temperature management is also vital, as high ambient temperatures can intensify respiratory distress [10]. For breeds prone to respiratory issues, particularly brachycephalic dogs and toy breeds, owners should understand their pet's anatomical limitations and avoid situations that might trigger respiratory distress [6, 10].

In high-risk cases, veterinarians should discuss the importance of limiting stressful situations and having an emergency plan, including the location of the nearest emergency facility equipped to handle respiratory crises [9].
