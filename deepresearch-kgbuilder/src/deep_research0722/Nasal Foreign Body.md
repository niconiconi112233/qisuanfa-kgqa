## Disease Overview: Nasal Foreign Body in Companion Animals

Nasal foreign body refers to any extraneous material that enters and becomes lodged in the nasal passages of dogs and cats. Foreign bodies in the nasal cavity are a relatively common cause of nasal disease in companion animals, characterized by distinct clinical presentations that help differentiate them from other nasal conditions.

The most frequent clinical signs include frequent and intense sneezing, pawing at the nose, and unilateral mucopurulent nasal discharge. In acute cases, animals present with sudden onset of violent sneezing, while subacute to chronic cases typically show persistent unilateral discharge [1]. Unlike nasal tumors, which often present with epistaxis and facial deformity, nasal foreign bodies rarely cause structural changes to the nose externally.

Diagnosis typically involves rhinoscopy under general anesthesia, where the foreign body can usually be visualized and removed with specialized forceps. Plant material (especially grass awns), small toys, and food items are among the most commonly retrieved objects [1]. Flushing and suction may be necessary when foreign bodies are covered in discharge.

Treatment involves removal of the foreign body either via endoscopic guidance or, in cases where endoscopic removal is unsuccessful, surgical exploration of the nasal sinuses may be necessary [1]. Prognosis following removal is excellent, with most animals showing rapid resolution of clinical signs.

## Etiology and Common Foreign Body Types

Nasal foreign bodies are common causes of respiratory distress in dogs and cats, characterized by frequent sneezing, pawing at the nose, and often unilateral mucopurulent nasal discharge in subacute to chronic cases. The foreign material becomes lodged in the nasal passages, causing irritation and inflammation of the nasal mucosa.

Common objects found in nasal passages include plant material (grass awns, foxtails, seeds), food particles, small toys, and pieces of bedding material. These objects typically enter through the nostrils during normal exploratory behavior, sniffing, or eating. Small dogs and cats with their narrow nasal passages are particularly susceptible to foreign body obstruction.

Predisposing factors that increase the risk of nasal foreign bodies include outdoor access, hunting behaviors, and curious temperaments that lead to exploratory sniffing. Brachycephalic breeds may have lower incidence rates due to their shortened nasal passages, while dolichocephalic (long-nosed) breeds may be at higher risk. Hunting and sporting breeds that frequently explore dense vegetation are particularly susceptible to plant material lodgment.

Foreign bodies typically cause unilateral symptoms, with obstruction of normal airflow through the affected side. Diagnosis requires careful physical examination and often rhinoscopy under general anesthesia to visualize and remove the object using specialized forceps.

## Clinical Symptoms and Presentation

Nasal foreign bodies typically produce a set of distinctive clinical signs that help veterinarians identify this condition. The most prominent symptom is sudden onset of violent sneezing fits, often accompanied by pawing at the face. This behavior directly results from irritation as the foreign material lodges in the nasal passage [7]. 

Dogs and cats with nasal foreign bodies commonly present with unilateral nasal discharge that begins as serous (clear) but often progresses to mucopurulent (containing mucus and pus) as secondary bacterial infection develops [3, 7]. In acute cases, the affected animal may show frequent sneezing, reverse sneezing, and facial rubbing or pawing at the nose [1, 4]. 

Respiratory distress may be evident through decreased airflow through the affected nasal passage [1, 3]. In more chronic cases, a malodorous discharge often develops, which can be a distinguishing feature compared to other nasal conditions [3]. Epistaxis (nose bleeding) may occur if the foreign body damages the highly vascular nasal mucosa [1, 7].

Behavioral changes can include depression, decreased appetite, and obvious discomfort. Unlike nasal tumors or fungal infections, pain on palpation of the nose is generally less common with foreign bodies [4, 7]. The timing and severity of symptoms directly correlate with the size, shape, and location of the foreign body within the nasal cavity.

## Diagnostic Approaches

Diagnosing nasal foreign bodies requires a systematic approach utilizing multiple diagnostic modalities. The initial step typically involves a thorough physical examination, assessing airflow through each nasal passage using cotton wisps or a cool glass slide to detect condensation. Unilateral nasal discharge, violent sneezing fits, pawing at the face, or ipsilateral facial muscle contractions strongly suggest a foreign body [1].

Rhinoscopy is considered the gold standard for visualization of nasal passages. Both anterior rhinoscopy and retrograde nasopharyngoscopy (examining the back of the nasal passages) are typically performed under general anesthesia. A 2.7mm rigid endoscope is ideal for most dogs, while a flexible bronchoscope is used for retrograde examination [2]. These techniques allow direct visualization of foreign materials, discharge, and mucosal abnormalities.

Advanced imaging techniques are often necessary. Radiography, particularly dorso-ventral intra-oral views, can detect radio-opaque foreign objects [3]. For non-opaque foreign bodies, computed tomography (CT) provides superior detail of bony structures, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) better visualizes soft tissue changes [4]. Ultrasound can identify foreign bodies by their hyperechoic surface echoes and acoustic shadowing [5].

When foreign bodies are suspected but not visualized, sinography (injecting contrast medium into draining tracts) may reveal the object as a filling defect [6]. Laboratory tests, including cytology of nasal discharge and biopsy of suspicious tissues, help rule out differential diagnoses such as neoplasia, fungal infections, or chronic rhinitis [7].

## Treatment Options and Management

The removal of nasal foreign bodies requires careful selection of treatment approaches based on the specific situation. Manual extraction can be performed if the foreign body is visible in the rostral nasal cavity using instruments like curved extraction forceps or grasping forceps with proper visualization [2]. For objects deeper in the nasal cavity, endoscopic removal under general anesthesia provides superior visualization and precision, allowing veterinarians to directly view and extract the foreign material with specialized instruments [2].

Nasal flushing is a crucial technique for both diagnosis and treatment. This procedure involves vigorously flushing sterile saline through one nostril while occluding the other, which can dislodge foreign materials and diagnostic fragments from the nasal cavity into the nasopharynx [4]. For effective flushing, the pet must be under general anesthesia with a properly sealed endotracheal tube to prevent aspiration, and the pharynx should be packed with sterile swabs to trap dislodged materials [4].

Post-removal care typically includes monitoring for proper healing, administering antibiotics to prevent secondary infections, and ensuring proper pain management [5]. Follow-up examinations are essential to confirm complete resolution and detect any potential complications. Proper post-operative care accelerates recovery, minimizes the risk of complications, and contributes significantly to successful outcomes [5].

## Complications and Prognosis

Untreated nasal foreign bodies can lead to several serious complications. Bacterial infection is a common consequence, potentially developing into cellulitis or abscess formation. If left untreated, these infections can progress rapidly, causing tissue necrosis and permanent damage to the delicate nasal structures [1]. Chronic inflammation may result in scarring and obstruction of nasal passages, potentially leading to nasopharyngeal stenosis in severe cases [2].

In some situations, foreign material can migrate deeper into tissues, causing damage to surrounding structures including the cribriform plate, which separates the nasal cavity from the brain. This can potentially lead to rhinitis, sinusitis, or in rare cases, extension of infection into the retrobulbar space or brain [3]. Intrusive luxation of teeth into the nasal cavity has been reported as a rare complication following trauma, resulting in chronic rhinitis and persistent nasal discharge [4].

With prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment, the prognosis for nasal foreign bodies is generally excellent. Most foreign materials can be successfully removed through flushing techniques or endoscopic retrieval [8]. Once the foreign body is removed, secondary infections typically resolve quickly with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. However, delayed treatment may result in chronic inflammation requiring longer courses of medication or additional interventions [1].

## Preventive Measures and Client Education

Preventing nasal foreign bodies in pets requires a comprehensive approach focused on environmental management and owner education. Pet owners should be taught to recognize high-risk objects that can be inhaled or lodged in the nasal cavity, including small toys, grass awns, plant material, and food particles. Frequent sneezing, unilateral nasal discharge, pawing at the face, and nasal bleeding are early warning signs that require immediate veterinary attention [1].

Environmental management is crucial for prevention. Owners should regularly inspect play areas for hazardous objects, keep small items out of pets' reach, and monitor chew toys for deterioration that could create inhalable fragments [2]. For dogs that enjoy outdoor activities, careful inspection of the face and nose after walks can help detect and remove plant material before it migrates into the nasal cavity.

Brachycephalic breeds require special consideration due to their anatomical predisposition to respiratory issues. These breeds should be closely monitored during play with small objects [3]. For all breeds, appropriate-sized toys and supervised play reduce the risk of foreign body aspiration.

Client education should emphasize the importance of early intervention when symptoms appear, as delayed treatment can lead to complications including chronic rhinitis and secondary bacterial infections [4].

## Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating pets with nasal foreign bodies, several conditions may present with similar clinical signs, making diagnosis challenging. Chronic rhinitis and sinusitis commonly mimic the symptoms of nasal foreign bodies, with both conditions causing nasal discharge, sneezing, and respiratory distress. Rhinitis can be inflammatory (lymphoplasmacytic) or infectious, with fungal infections like aspergillosis being particularly important in dogs [1, 2].

Nasal tumors are another key differential diagnosis, especially in middle-aged to older animals. Tumors typically cause progressive symptoms with unilateral discharge that may become bilateral as disease advances. Unlike foreign bodies, tumors often cause facial deformity, reduced airflow, and occasionally epistaxis [2, 5].

Dental disease with oronasal fistulas can mimic foreign body symptoms, particularly when there's a malodorous unilateral discharge. Additionally, congenital abnormalities such as choanal atresia, while rare, may present with similar symptoms [5].

In cats, chronic rhinosinusitis, nasopharyngeal polyps, and cryptococcal granulomas should be considered [4, 9]. The pattern of symptoms (unilateral vs. bilateral), character of discharge, presence of pain, and airflow assessment provide important clues for differentiating these conditions from foreign bodies [2].
