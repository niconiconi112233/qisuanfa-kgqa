## Introduction to Laryngeal Foreign Bodies

Laryngeal foreign bodies represent a serious and potentially life-threatening emergency condition in dogs and cats. These occur when objects become lodged in the larynx - the structure at the top of the airway that guards the entrance to the trachea. The larynx plays a crucial role in respiration by protecting the airways while allowing air passage, and any obstruction significantly impacts an animal's ability to breathe normally.

Common clinical signs include respiratory distress, retching, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), drooling, coughing, and in severe cases, open-mouth breathing with extended neck posture. Animals may present with tachypnea, anxiety, cyanosis, and nares flaring. Stick injuries are particularly common in dogs that chew on or retrieve sticks, which can penetrate the oral cavity and pharyngolaryngeal area.

Immediate veterinary attention is essential, as laryngeal foreign bodies can rapidly progress to respiratory crisis and death. The diagnosis typically requires sedated examination of the larynx, although diagnostic imaging like radiography may help identify the location and nature of the obstruction. Treatment usually involves carefully removing the foreign body, addressing any associated trauma, and providing supportive care.

Prevention includes avoiding small objects that could be inhaled and supervising play with sticks or other potentially dangerous items.

## Etiology and Risk Factors

Laryngeal foreign bodies in companion animals can result from various materials becoming lodged in the larynx, creating a potentially life-threatening obstruction. Common foreign materials include small toys, sticks, bones, dental chews, sewing needles, and grass awns. These objects may lodge at anatomical narrowings in the upper respiratory tract, particularly at the thoracic inlet, heart base, and caudal esophagus, where extra-esophageal structures limit dilation.

In cats, sewing needles are among the most common esophageal foreign bodies, with a 17% rate of perforation. For dogs, bones and dental chews pose significant risks. Certain breeds demonstrate predisposition to foreign body ingestion, including terriers, spaniels, and collies. Young, playful, or curious dogs are at highest risk, although older dogs may develop pica behavior secondary to conditions like intestinal tumors, inflammatory bowel disease, or endocrine disorders.

Behavioral factors significantly influence risk, with compulsive and repetitive behaviors potentially leading to foreign body ingestion. Some breeds show specific behavioral tendencies - for example, Border Collies may chase shadows, while Bull Terriers demonstrate spinning behaviors, increasing their likelihood of encountering and ingesting foreign materials.

Anatomical factors also contribute to risk, as objects that pass through the mouth may become trapped at the narrowed areas of the respiratory or digestive tract, particularly the larynx, creating obstruction that requires immediate veterinary intervention.

## Clinical Signs and Presentation

Laryngeal foreign bodies in dogs and cats present with characteristic symptoms that primarily affect respiration. The most common clinical signs include vomiting (87%), anorexia (72%), inspiratory dyspnea, and stertor (snoring or snorting sounds) due to airway obstruction rostral to the larynx. Dogs and cats may also exhibit gagging, excessive swallowing, coughing, and paroxysmal reverse sneezing [1].

Species differences are notable in presentation. Cats appear more tolerant of linear foreign bodies and may have signs for several days before diagnosis, whereas dogs tend to develop intestinal perforation more readily, leading to faster deterioration [2]. When a string or linear foreign body becomes caught under the tongue, it creates a specific presentation pattern where one end is anchored in the mouth while the other end extends into the gastrointestinal tract.

Physical examination may reveal palpable plicated intestines in linear foreign body cases. This plication (bunching of intestines along the string) is a hallmark finding [3]. In some cases, the foreign body may be visible or palpable in the oral cavity or at the anus. Examination should always include lifting the tongue to check for strings wrapped around its base, especially in cats who commonly play with string-like objects [3].

The severity and progression of symptoms vary depending on the duration of obstruction, with longer duration of clinical signs associated with significantly increased mortality rates [4].

# Diagnostic Approach

Diagnosing laryngeal foreign bodies requires a systematic approach combining physical examination, imaging techniques, and endoscopic procedures. Early detection is crucial as these obstructions can compromise breathing and lead to respiratory distress.

Physical examination is the initial step in diagnosis, with attention to respiratory patterns, stridor, dysphonia, and pain on neck palpation. Animals with laryngeal foreign bodies often present with acute respiratory distress, drooling, and difficulty swallowing. Subcutaneous emphysema in the cervical region may be observed if perforation has occurred [10].

Radiography serves as the first-line imaging modality, with lateral and ventrodorsal views of the head, neck, and thorax recommended for initial assessment. While radiopaque objects like metal or glass are easily visualized, many foreign bodies (wood, plastic) remain undetectable radiographically. Secondary signs such as soft tissue swelling, subcutaneous emphysema, or gas between fascial planes may indicate foreign body presence [10].

For cases where radiographs are inconclusive, advanced imaging becomes valuable. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer superior tissue contrast and can detect radiolucent foreign bodies that conventional radiography misses [2]. These modalities provide detailed pre-surgical evaluation and help determine the extent of tissue involvement [7].

Endoscopy remains the gold standard for diagnosis, allowing direct visualization of the larynx and potential retrieval of the foreign body. Under general anesthesia, a thorough examination of the entire oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and rostral esophagus can be performed [4]. For laryngeal examination, a light plane of anesthesia is preferred to maintain protective reflexes. A respiratory stimulant like doxapram hydrochloride may be administered to stimulate breathing and better assess laryngeal function [1][5].

Bronchoalveolar lavage can be performed concurrently during endoscopy when lower respiratory involvement is suspected, providing samples for cytology and bacterial culture [3].

In chronic cases with draining tracts, sinography may help identify the foreign body and its migration path. Ultrasonography can also be useful in detecting non-radiopaque foreign bodies when they're surrounded by inflammatory fluid [7].

## Emergency Stabilization and Treatment

When an animal presents with a laryngeal foreign body, immediate intervention is crucial as respiratory distress can rapidly become life-threatening. Oxygen supplementation should be the first step in stabilization, provided in a stress-free manner at high flow rates (5-15 L/min) via mask, flow-by, or oxygen cage. The animal should be allowed to maintain its preferred position, often with head and neck extended to maximize airway patency [6].

Sedation with butorphanol (0.2-0.4 mg/kg IM, SC, or IV) can help reduce distress while minimizing cardiorespiratory depression [1, 6]. Medetomidine and ketamine should be avoided due to their significant effects on systemic vascular resistance [4].

Once minimally stabilized, thorough but gentle examination of the upper respiratory tract is needed. Visual inspection using careful sedation may identify and allow removal of the foreign body. If the laryngeal obstruction is severe or complete, emergency airway access via orotracheal intubation or tracheostomy may be necessary [9]. Glucocorticosteroids can help reduce laryngeal swelling and inflammation caused by the foreign body [1].

During all procedures, stress should be minimized as agitation can worsen respiratory compromise. Handle the patient with care, maintain a quiet environment, and provide continuous oxygen supplementation [6]. After foreign body removal, monitoring for potential complications including laryngeal swelling, pulmonary edema, and aspiration pneumonia is essential [2, 4].

## Definitive Treatment Options

Removal of laryngeal foreign bodies requires a strategic approach based on the location, type of object, and patient condition. Non-surgical interventions are generally attempted first, including endoscopic retrieval under general anesthesia. Laryngoscopy allows direct visualization of the foreign body, with flexible fiber-optic or video bronchoscopes (3-4 mm diameter) preferred for cats due to their smaller airways [1]. Specialized tools such as grasping forceps can be introduced through the bronchoscope's biopsy channel for object removal.

When endoscopic removal fails, surgical approaches become necessary. Options include a ventral laryngotomy or, in severe cases, tracheostomy for emergency airway access [2]. For objects extending into the esophagus, a combination of surgical cutting of the perforated part and endoscopic retrieval may be required [3].

The success rate for endoscopic foreign body removal in the upper respiratory tract is high (93% in one study), with a 98% survival rate [3]. Potential complications include laryngeal swelling or edema, airway obstruction during recovery, aspiration pneumonia, and infection at the surgical site [2]. Perforation of the laryngeal mucosa can lead to abscess formation, though postoperative infection is uncommon and usually responds well to antibiotic therapy [2].

Post-procedural care includes administering supplemental oxygen, close monitoring for respiratory distress, and sometimes corticosteroids to reduce inflammation [1].

## Post-Treatment Care and Complications

After laryngeal foreign body removal, vigilant post-operative monitoring is essential for patient recovery and prevention of complications. During the immediate recovery period, vital signs including body temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, and mucous membrane color should be monitored every 15 minutes initially, extending to 30-minute or hourly checks as the animal stabilizes [1,2].

Respiratory complications are the most significant concern, as airway swelling or residual damage may cause respiratory distress. Animals should be observed for signs of respiratory compromise, including rapid shallow breathing, abnormal respiratory sounds, or difficulty expanding the chest [2]. In brachycephalic breeds, airway obstruction is a particular risk, and maintaining the endotracheal tube until the animal is fully aware may be necessary [2].

Pain management is crucial, as discomfort may lead to agitation and complicate recovery. Administering analgesics before the patient becomes aware of pain provides better control [2]. Owners should follow medication schedules precisely to prevent complications [1].

Activity restriction may be required to prevent stress on the surgical site. Keeping pets calm during recovery can be challenging but is important to prevent excitement that could lead to respiratory distress [1,2]. Using protective devices like E-collars may be necessary to prevent self-trauma to the surgical site [1].

Regular veterinary follow-up appointments are essential to ensure proper healing and to address any emerging complications promptly.

## Prevention Strategies

Preventing laryngeal foreign bodies requires a comprehensive approach focusing on environmental management and owner education. One key strategy is to supervise pets during playtime, especially with small toys or objects that could be aspirated. Pet owners should regularly inspect toys for damage and discard those that are torn or have small detachable parts that could become lodged in the airway.

Environmental management is crucial - keeping string, thread, yarn, and similar linear objects out of pets' reach prevents potentially serious foreign body issues. Cats are particularly attracted to these items, which can become lodged around the base of the tongue and cause severe complications.

Pet owners should be educated to use harnesses instead of collars, especially for dogs with respiratory issues, as collars can put pressure on the larynx and potentially worsen airway obstruction during an emergency. This simple change significantly reduces stress on the laryngeal area.

Creating a safe space for pets is essential. Owners should "pet-proof" their homes by securing loose items, properly storing craft supplies, and being mindful of household objects that curious pets might ingest. Regular environmental scans for potential hazards should become routine.

Prompt veterinary attention at the first sign of choking, gagging, or respiratory distress is vital, as early intervention dramatically improves outcomes in foreign body cases.

## Conclusion and Clinical Implications

Laryngeal foreign bodies represent acute, life-threatening emergencies requiring rapid recognition and intervention. Success hinges on efficient triage, appropriate diagnostic techniques, and measured interventions tailored to the patient's condition. Key takeaways for veterinary professionals include:

- Early recognition of clinical signs, particularly respiratory distress, gagging, and stertor, is critical for survival
- Oxygen supplementation and minimal handling should precede definitive treatment
- Endoscopic retrieval has high success rates (93%) when performed by skilled practitioners
- Post-removal monitoring must focus on potential complications like laryngeal edema and aspiration pneumonia

Prevention remains the most effective strategy, with client education forming the cornerstone of management. Teaching owners to remove hazardous objects from pets' environments, supervise play with small toys, and seek immediate care at the first sign of respiratory distress significantly reduces risk. The integration of thorough diagnostics, careful emergency stabilization, and appropriate intervention techniques optimizes outcomes for affected animals, underscoring the importance of preparedness for these challenging but manageable emergencies.
