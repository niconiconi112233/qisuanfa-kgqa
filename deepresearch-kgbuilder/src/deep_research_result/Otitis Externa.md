Based on the provided source material, I'll write a Disease Overview section for otitis externa in pets:

## Disease Overview

Otitis externa is inflammation of the external ear canal and ear pinna (outer ear flap). It is one of the most common reasons for pets, especially dogs, to be presented to veterinarians, with a one-year period prevalence of 7.30% reported in UK primary care practices [1,2]. The condition can be either acute or chronic, with chronic cases defined as persistent or recurrent otitis lasting 3 months or longer [1].

The external ear canal is lined with epithelial cells, hair follicles, and both sebaceous and ceruminous glands. Changes that occur during otitis externa include glandular hyperplasia, glandular dilation, epithelial hyperplasia, and hyperkeratosis. These changes typically result in increased cerumen production along the ear canal, leading to higher humidity and pH levels that predispose the ear to secondary infections [1]. 

The bacteria most commonly isolated from affected ear canals include Staphylococcus species, Pseudomonas, Proteus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus and Corynebacterium. Malassezia yeast is another common finding. Some bacterial species like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas can produce protective biofilms that make infections more difficult to treat [1].

## Common Pathogens

Otitis externa involves several key pathogenic organisms. The most prevalent bacterial pathogens include Staphylococcus species, which are commonly isolated from affected ear canals [1]. Other significant bacterial causes include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Corynebacterium [2]. Some bacteria, particularly Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas, can produce protective biofilms that make infections more persistent and difficult to treat.

Malassezia pachydermatis is the primary fungal pathogen involved in otitis externa [1]. This yeast organism is normally present in small numbers in healthy ears but can proliferate extensively during infection. Some dogs may even develop allergic responses to Malassezia, leading to increased inflammation and discomfort [2].

Parasitic causes include mites such as Otodectes cynotis (ear mites), Demodex species, and Psoroptes cuniculi (in rabbits) [2]. These parasites can directly damage the ear canal and create an environment conducive to secondary bacterial and fungal infections.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Otitis externa presents with several characteristic clinical signs that help veterinarians make an accurate diagnosis. The most common symptoms include head shaking, ear scratching, and evident pain or discomfort when the ears are touched [1]. Affected animals often display erythema (redness) and swelling of the ear canal, accompanied by varying amounts of discharge that can range from waxy to purulent in nature [1].

The ear discharge frequently has a foul odor and may appear as dark brown-green exudate in severe cases [1]. Dogs may exhibit altered ear carriage and increased sensitivity around the ear area. Non-specific signs can include pruritus (itching) and general discomfort around the head and ear region [2].

In chronic cases, pathological changes can occur within the ear canal, including glandular hyperplasia, stenosis (narrowing), and potential mineralization of the canal tissues [1]. These changes often result in increased cerumen production, which raises local humidity and pH levels in the ear canal, creating conditions favorable for secondary infections [1].

If left untreated, the condition can progress to cause hearing deficits and may extend into the middle ear, leading to more serious complications [1]. The severity and combination of symptoms can vary significantly between individual cases.

## Diagnostic Methods

The diagnosis of otitis externa requires a comprehensive approach combining several key diagnostic methods. The initial evaluation begins with a thorough physical examination and otoscopic visualization of the ear canals, which helps identify inflammation, discharge, masses, or foreign bodies. Cytologic examination of ear canal discharge is considered essential and should be performed on all cases to identify bacterial or yeast overgrowth [1].

Further diagnostic tools include video otoscopy, which provides enhanced visualization and magnification of the ear canal and tympanic membrane. This allows better assessment of ear canal changes and helps guide treatment decisions. Bacterial culture and sensitivity testing is recommended in chronic or recurrent cases, particularly when rod-shaped bacteria are observed on cytology or when there is poor response to initial therapy [2].

Advanced imaging may be necessary in complicated cases. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are more reliable than traditional radiography for evaluating middle and inner ear involvement. CT has shown 86% sensitivity and 89% specificity for diagnosing otitis media compared to histopathology [3]. Additionally, ultrasound can be useful for detecting fluid within the tympanic bulla with 80-100% sensitivity [3].

## Treatment Options

Treatment of otitis externa typically requires a comprehensive approach focusing on cleaning, medication, and inflammation control. Primary treatment involves thorough cleaning of the ear canal to remove debris and discharge, which helps medications work more effectively. Medicated ear drops containing combinations of antibiotics, antifungals, and anti-inflammatory agents are commonly prescribed based on the specific cause and severity of infection.

For painful acute cases, oral corticosteroids may be prescribed to reduce inflammation and discomfort [1]. The specific medication protocol is determined after identifying the underlying cause through diagnostic tests. Treatment must address both the primary condition and any secondary infections.

Key aspects of treatment include:
- Regular ear cleaning and debris removal
- Topical antimicrobial/antifungal medications 
- Anti-inflammatory medications to reduce swelling
- Treatment of underlying allergies or other primary causes
- Management of predisposing factors like excessive moisture
- Follow-up examinations to monitor response

Patient compliance and proper administration of medications are essential for successful treatment. The duration of therapy varies but typically continues for 1-2 weeks beyond clinical resolution to prevent recurrence [2].

Based on the source material, I'll write a section on preventive measures for otitis externa.

## Preventive Measures

Several key strategies can help prevent otitis externa in dogs. Regular ear examinations during routine veterinary visits allow for early detection of mild cases before they become serious infections [1]. For dogs who swim frequently, careful drying and cleaning of the ears after water exposure is essential, particularly for breeds with drop ears like Labradors and Golden Retrievers. Using cotton balls to gently wipe out ear canals and keeping them dry helps prevent the warm, moist environment that promotes bacterial and yeast growth [2].

For dogs with allergies, which are a major underlying cause of recurrent ear infections, proper allergy management is crucial. This may involve identifying specific allergens through skin or blood testing, followed by immunotherapy treatment for long-term control [2]. Maintaining pets on consistent flea prevention and keeping their diet and environment stable can also help prevent flare-ups [1].

For dogs with a history of recurrent infections, proactive use of medicated ear cleaners and regular monitoring can help prevent new episodes. Working closely with a veterinarian to develop a maintenance protocol is important, as prevention is far more effective than treating established infections [3,4].

Based on the source material, I'll write the Differential Diagnosis section for otitis externa:

## Differential Diagnosis

Several conditions can present with symptoms similar to otitis externa and must be differentiated through careful diagnostic workup. Otitis media is a key differential, occurring in up to 50% of chronic otitis externa cases [1]. While otitis externa affects the external ear canal, otitis media involves the middle ear and may present with additional neurological signs like head tilt, nystagmus, ataxia, and cranial nerve deficits. Notably, an intact tympanic membrane does not rule out otitis media [1].

Other important differentials include inflammatory polyps, which typically arise from the middle ear mucosa or auditory tube and can extend into the external ear canal, particularly in cats [2]. Neoplasia of the ear canal must also be considered, especially with unilateral chronic disease. In cats specifically, ceruminous cystomatosis can affect the ear canal and pinna, presenting with multiple blue-tinged nodules that may be mistaken for infection [2].

Additionally, proliferative necrotizing otitis, though rare, should be considered particularly in young cats presenting with sharply marginated erythematous crusted plaques affecting the concave pinna and ear canal [2]. Thorough otoscopic examination, cytology, and in some cases imaging studies are essential for differentiating these conditions.
