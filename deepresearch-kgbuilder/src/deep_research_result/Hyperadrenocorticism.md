## Disease Overview

Hyperadrenocorticism, commonly known as Cushing's disease or Cushing's syndrome, is a relatively common endocrine disorder characterized by excessive production of cortisol hormones by the adrenal glands [1]. There are three main types: pituitary-dependent (about 85-90% of cases), adrenal-dependent (about 15% of cases), and iatrogenic, which is caused by prolonged use of steroid medications [1,2].

The condition occurs predominantly in middle-aged to older dogs, typically between 7-12 years old. Certain breeds show predisposition, including Miniature Poodles, Dachshunds, Boxers, Boston Terriers, and Yorkshire Terriers [3]. While it primarily affects dogs, the condition can also occur in cats, though much more rarely [2].

The disease develops when the body is exposed to excessive cortisol over extended periods. In pituitary-dependent cases, a tumor in the pituitary gland causes overproduction of ACTH hormone, which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce excess cortisol. In adrenal-dependent cases, a tumor in the adrenal gland directly produces excessive cortisol [1,3].

## Common Pathogens

Hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing's disease) is not caused by viral, bacterial or other infectious pathogens. Rather, it results from three main pathological mechanisms that lead to excessive cortisol in the body. The most common cause is a benign tumor in the pituitary gland, accounting for approximately 85% of cases in dogs. This pituitary tumor produces excess ACTH hormone which stimulates the adrenal glands to overproduce cortisol [1]. The second cause is a functional tumor (benign or malignant) in one of the adrenal glands itself, occurring in about 15% of cases [2]. The third type is iatrogenic Cushing's, which develops from prolonged administration of steroid medications rather than from any pathogen [2,3].

While infections are not a cause of Cushing's disease, affected animals become more susceptible to secondary bacterial and fungal infections due to the immunosuppressive effects of elevated cortisol. Around 50% of dogs with Cushing's disease have concurrent urinary tract infections at diagnosis, and they are also prone to skin infections and respiratory infections [2,3].

Here is my attempt at writing the Clinical Symptoms and Signs section:

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

The key clinical signs of hyperadrenocorticism include increased thirst and urination (polyuria/polydipsia), increased appetite (polyphagia), lethargy, muscle weakness, and a characteristic pot-bellied appearance due to abdominal enlargement [1,2]. Common dermatological changes include hair loss (alopecia), thin fragile skin, bruising, hyperpigmentation, and poor wound healing [1]. 

Dogs may also show excessive panting, recurrent urinary tract infections, and calcinosis cutis (calcium deposits in the skin) [1]. Cats with hyperadrenocorticism display similar signs but are more likely to have severe skin fragility leading to tears and self-inflicted wounds [2,3]. Additionally, about 80% of cats with hyperadrenocorticism develop concurrent diabetes mellitus, compared to only 10% of affected dogs [1,4].

Less common manifestations can include systemic hypertension, blood clots, bronchial calcification, heart failure, behavior changes, and visual deficits [1]. The disease primarily affects middle-aged to older animals, with dogs showing no clear sex predisposition, while approximately 75% of affected cats are female [1,4].

Based on the provided source material, I'll write a comprehensive section on diagnostic methods for hyperadrenocorticism.

## Diagnostic Methods

The diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism involves multiple testing approaches, with the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST) considered the most accurate screening test for initial diagnosis [1]. This test involves measuring baseline cortisol, administering dexamethasone intravenously, and checking cortisol levels again at 4 and 8 hours. Approximately 90% of dogs with Cushing's disease will test positive using this method [1].

The ACTH stimulation test is another crucial diagnostic tool, particularly useful when there's a history of steroid medication use or concurrent medical conditions like diabetes mellitus. This test measures the adrenal glands' response to synthetic ACTH injection by comparing cortisol levels before and after administration [2]. While slightly less sensitive than LDDST, it offers higher specificity and is essential for monitoring treatment response [1].

Additional screening methods include the urine cortisol:creatinine ratio (UCCR), which serves as an excellent initial screening tool. However, since stress or other illnesses can affect results, positive UCCR findings should be confirmed with either LDDST or ACTH stimulation testing [3]. Diagnostic imaging, including abdominal ultrasound, CT, or MRI, may also be necessary to differentiate between pituitary-dependent and adrenal-dependent disease and to visualize potential tumors [2].

## Treatment Options

Hyperadrenocorticism can be managed through several treatment approaches, with trilostane currently being the most widely used medical therapy [1,2]. As the FDA-approved treatment for both pituitary and adrenal-dependent forms, trilostane works by inhibiting cortisol production through blocking key enzymes in the adrenal glands [2,5].

For surgical options, hypophysectomy (removal of the pituitary tumor) can be performed at select institutions, offering potential cure with >75% two-year survival rates, though it requires lifelong hormone replacement. Radiation therapy is another option but typically doesn't fully reverse the condition [3].

Medical management with trilostane typically starts at 2-3 mg/kg daily, given with food. The dose often needs adjustment based on patient response. Close monitoring is essential, with rechecks recommended at 10-14 days after starting, one month later, and then every 4-6 months [5]. Common side effects include mild and usually self-limiting gastrointestinal issues, though rarely adrenal necrosis can occur [2].

Mitotane was historically used but requires careful dosing to avoid complete adrenal destruction. Other medications like ketoconazole and L-deprenyl are less commonly used due to limited efficacy [5]. The choice of therapy should be individualized based on factors like cost, monitoring requirements, and patient-specific considerations.

I apologize, but I cannot write a comprehensive and factual section about preventive measures for hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing's disease) without valid source material to reference. Writing without verified sources could lead to inaccurate or misleading health information, which could be dangerous for pet owners and their animals.

To properly write this section, we would need reliable sources that discuss:
1. Any known preventive strategies for hyperadrenocorticism
2. Risk factors that can be managed
3. Early warning signs to watch for
4. Recommended screening protocols
5. Any genetic or environmental factors that may be controllable

I recommend gathering information from:
- Veterinary medical journals
- Veterinary association guidelines
- Academic veterinary institutions
- Reputable veterinary medical websites

Once you provide verified source material, I can help write an accurate and helpful section on preventive measures for hyperadrenocorticism.

## Differential Diagnosis

Several conditions need to be considered in the differential diagnosis for hyperadrenocorticism due to overlapping clinical signs. The most common condition to rule out is allergic disease, particularly in dogs with recurring skin infections and pyoderma. Age can help differentiate between these conditions, as allergic dogs typically present at a younger age compared to hyperadrenocorticism which occurs in middle-aged to older dogs [1].

Other endocrine disorders, particularly hypothyroidism, should be considered as a differential diagnosis in middle-aged to older dogs presenting with dermatologic changes and metabolic abnormalities [1]. Dogs with diabetes mellitus may show similar clinical signs like polyuria/polydipsia and increased liver enzymes [2].

For dogs presenting primarily with dermatologic signs but lacking other classic physical findings of hyperadrenocorticism, chronic bacterial skin infections and demodicosis should be investigated [1]. If only biochemical abnormalities like elevated alkaline phosphatase are noted without supporting clinical signs, other hepatobiliary conditions and physiologic stress should be considered before pursuing extensive endocrine testing [3].

Given the varied presentation of hyperadrenocorticism, maintaining a broad differential list while focusing on the patient's age, clinical signs, and laboratory findings helps guide the diagnostic approach.
