## Disease Overview

Grape and raisin toxicosis is a potentially severe condition that causes acute kidney injury (AKI) in dogs following ingestion of grapes, raisins, currants and other fruits from the Vitis species [1]. The exact toxic mechanism remains unknown, though tartaric acid has been proposed as the toxic principle, as dogs lack the organic acid transporters needed to properly excrete it [1].

This toxicity was first reported in 1998 and has been documented primarily in dogs, though there are anecdotal reports in cats and ferrets [1,2]. The minimum toxic dose is unclear and appears idiosyncratic - while estimates suggest grapes at 0.7 oz/kg body weight and raisins at 0.11 oz/kg may be toxic, adverse effects have been reported with much smaller amounts [2,3]. 

Clinical signs typically develop within 24-48 hours of ingestion and include vomiting, lethargy, abdominal pain, and signs of acute kidney injury such as oliguria or anuria [2]. The kidney damage can be severe, with some dogs progressing to oliguric or anuric renal failure within 72 hours of exposure [1]. Early recognition, decontamination and aggressive supportive care are essential for improving outcomes [2].

Based on the provided source material, I'll write the Common Pathogens section focusing on the causative agents associated with grape and raisin toxicosis.

## Common Pathogens

The exact pathogenic mechanism behind grape and raisin toxicosis in dogs remains unknown, though several potential causative agents have been investigated. While mycotoxins were initially suspected as a possible cause, no specific mycotoxins have been identified in grapes or raisins ingested by affected dogs [1,2]. Recent evidence suggests that tartaric acid, an organic acid found naturally in grapes and raisins, may be the primary toxic agent. Dogs have limited ability to excrete organic acids due to their lack of organic acid transporters, which could allow tartaric acid to accumulate in proximal renal tubular cells [1]. The toxic effects appear to occur regardless of grape type or source, affecting dogs that consume both seedless and seeded grapes, store-bought and homegrown grapes, as well as grape pressings from wineries [2]. This suggests the toxic agent is inherent to grapes themselves rather than from external contaminants like pesticides or heavy metals. The condition is not caused by infectious pathogens like bacteria or viruses.

Based on the provided source material, I'll write a section on Clinical Symptoms and Signs of grape and raisin toxicosis.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

The initial clinical signs of grape and raisin toxicosis typically appear within 6-12 hours after ingestion. Vomiting is one of the earliest and most consistent symptoms, occurring in nearly all affected dogs within the first 24-48 hours. This may be followed by lethargy, anorexia, diarrhea, and abdominal pain [1].

As the condition progresses, dogs commonly develop signs of acute kidney injury including polydipsia, oliguria (reduced urine production), or anuria (no urine production). Severe neurological signs may also occur in some dogs, including ataxia, impaired consciousness, tremors, and abnormal gait. These neurological symptoms can be quite pronounced and may involve the forebrain, cerebellum, or vestibular system [1,2].

Additional clinical signs include dehydration, hypothermia, and weakness. Blood work typically reveals rapidly developing azotemia within 48 hours of ingestion, along with elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. Without prompt treatment, affected dogs can progress to severe acute kidney failure within 24-72 hours after exposure [1,3]. The severity of symptoms does not necessarily correlate with the amount of grapes or raisins consumed.

## Diagnostic Methods

The diagnosis of grape and raisin toxicosis primarily relies on obtaining a thorough history of exposure along with evaluation of clinical signs [1]. Initial symptoms typically appear within 6-12 hours after ingestion and include vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, anorexia, abdominal pain, weakness, dehydration, polydipsia, and tremors [1].

Laboratory testing reveals some key abnormalities. Serum creatinine concentrations tend to rise before blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, with disproportionately higher elevations in creatinine compared to BUN [1]. Some dogs may also show transient increases in serum glucose, liver enzymes, pancreatic enzymes, calcium, and phosphorus [1].

When evaluating a suspected case, veterinarians must consider other potential causes of acute kidney failure in their differential diagnosis, particularly ethylene glycol toxicity and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) poisoning [1]. Since there is no specific diagnostic test for grape/raisin toxicity, the combination of exposure history, characteristic clinical presentation, and laboratory findings showing acute kidney injury helps establish the diagnosis.

## Treatment Options

Treatment for grape and raisin toxicosis requires prompt action and typically involves multiple therapeutic approaches. Early gastrointestinal decontamination is crucial as the first line of treatment [1,2].

For recent ingestions within 12 hours, emesis should be induced if the patient is asymptomatic. This can be done using apomorphine (0.03-0.04 mg/kg IV/IM) or ropinirole in the conjunctival sac [3,4]. Following emesis, activated charcoal should be administered to prevent further toxin absorption.

Aggressive intravenous fluid therapy is essential and should be maintained for at least 48 hours while closely monitoring renal function [3]. For oliguric dogs, urine production can be stimulated using dopamine (0.5-3 mcg/kg/min IV) or furosemide [4].

Additional supportive care includes:
- Antiemetics like maropitant or ondansetron for vomiting control 
- GI protectants such as sucralfate and proton pump inhibitors
- Vitamin K1 supplementation for coagulopathy
- Treatment of hypertension with ACE inhibitors if needed
- Nutritional support during hospitalization [2,4]

For patients that develop anuric renal failure, peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis may be required, though prognosis remains guarded even with advanced interventions [3,4].

Based on the source material, I'll write the Preventive Measures section for grape and raisin toxicosis in pets:

## Preventive Measures

The primary preventive measure for grape and raisin toxicosis is strict dietary management and environmental control. Pet owners should completely avoid feeding dogs any grapes, raisins, or foods containing these ingredients, including raisin bread, trail mix, cereals with raisins, and chocolate-covered raisins [1]. Even organic or homegrown grapes can be toxic, so no type of grape or raisin should be considered safe [2].

Environmental management is also crucial. Bird feeders containing raisin-containing food mixes should be placed where dogs cannot access fallen pieces [3]. All grape and raisin products should be stored securely in closed cabinets or pantries out of pets' reach. Since the toxic mechanism remains unknown and there is no established safe amount, prevention through complete avoidance is essential [1].

If grape or raisin ingestion occurs, immediate veterinary care should be sought, as prompt decontamination and treatment significantly improve prognosis [2]. Pet owners should also be aware that grapes and raisins can stay in a dog's stomach for an extended period, making quick action important even hours after ingestion [2].

I apologize, but I am unable to write the Differential Diagnosis section for Grape and Raisin Toxicosis because no source material was provided. To write an accurate, well-cited section about diseases with similar clinical signs, I would need:

1. Verified medical sources describing the clinical signs of grape/raisin toxicosis
2. Sources discussing other conditions that present with similar symptoms
3. Veterinary literature discussing the differential diagnosis process for this condition

Without credible sources to cite, I cannot make specific claims about which other diseases should be considered in the differential diagnosis, as this could potentially spread misinformation about a serious medical condition. I recommend:

1. Gathering sources from veterinary medical journals
2. Consulting veterinary toxicology databases
3. Including clinical guidelines from veterinary organizations
4. Finding case studies documenting differential diagnoses

Would you like to provide additional source material so I can write this section appropriately?
