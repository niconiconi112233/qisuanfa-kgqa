Based on the provided source material, I'll write a disease overview section for lymphocytosis in companion animals.

## Disease Overview

Lymphocytosis is a hematologic condition characterized by an elevated absolute lymphocyte count above the laboratory reference range, typically exceeding 5,000 cells/Î¼L in dogs [1]. This condition can manifest as either an isolated finding or occur secondary to other systemic conditions. While lymphocytosis appears relatively uncommon in companion animals, epidemiological data from over 27,000 complete blood counts shows it occurs in only 0.6% of cases, with 45% of these occurring in dogs under 3 years of age [3].

The condition can be either reactive or neoplastic in nature. Common reactive causes include age-related lymphocytosis in young animals (under 6 months) due to vaccination or novel antigen exposure, infections like Ehrlichia canis, and endocrine disorders such as hyperthyroidism in cats and hypoadrenocorticism in dogs [1]. Neoplastic causes include lymphoid malignancies like acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-lymphoid tumors such as thymoma [1].

When evaluating lymphocytosis, it's important to distinguish between isolated lymphocytosis and mild elevations occurring secondary to marked leukocytosis from severe inflammation or immunologic diseases. The clinical approach should focus on determining the underlying cause, as this drives both prognosis and treatment decisions [3].

## Common Pathogens

Lymphocytosis in dogs and cats can be caused by various infectious and non-infectious agents. Viral infections like Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) are known triggers [1]. The bacterial pathogen Ehrlichia canis is one of the most common infectious causes of lymphocytosis, while protozoal infections like Leishmania infantum occur less frequently [2].

In cats, epinephrine-mediated physiologic responses can cause temporary lymphocytosis, particularly in response to stress or excitement. Young animals under 6 months of age often develop mild lymphocytosis due to vaccination or exposure to novel antigens [2].

In addition to pathogens, chronic antigenic stimulation from bacterial, viral, or fungal infections (especially systemic fungal infections) can lead to increased lymphocyte counts [1]. Immune-mediated conditions, though rare, may also trigger lymphocytosis - for example, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia in cats [2].

The nature and severity of lymphocytosis often helps differentiate between infectious and non-infectious causes. While infection-related lymphocytosis can be quite marked, physiologic causes like stress typically result in milder elevations [3].

Based on the source material, I'll write the Clinical Symptoms and Signs section for lymphocytosis in pets:

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

The clinical presentation of lymphocytosis varies depending on the underlying cause. Many cases, particularly in the early stages, show no obvious clinical signs and are detected incidentally during routine blood work [1]. When symptoms do occur, they commonly include lethargy, reduced appetite, weight loss, fever, and increased drinking and urination [1].

Physical examination may reveal mildly enlarged lymph nodes and/or an enlarged liver or spleen. In rare cases, patients can develop a more aggressive form called Richter's syndrome, characterized by severe lymph node enlargement, coughing, vomiting, weight loss, and neurological signs [1].

Mild cases often have minimal clinical signs, especially in young animals under 3 years old where transient lymphocytosis is more common. However, mature adult dogs with isolated lymphocytosis (without other blood cell abnormalities) should be evaluated carefully, as lymphoproliferative disorders like lymphoma or leukemia are common underlying causes [2].

Clinicians should be cautious about over-interpreting mild lymphocytosis when it occurs alongside severe leukocytosis from inflammation or immune conditions. Additionally, a relative increase in lymphocyte percentage without an absolute increase in lymphocyte count has no clinical significance [2].

Based on the source material, I'll write the Diagnostic Methods section for lymphocytosis:

## Diagnostic Methods

The diagnostic approach to lymphocytosis requires multiple steps and methods to determine the underlying cause. Blood smear review by a clinical pathologist is essential as the first step, even when automated analyzers report lymphocytosis [1,2]. The pathologist evaluates cell morphology including size, nuclear characteristics, cytoplasmic features, and looks for any characteristic inclusions or abnormalities [2].

Flow cytometry is a key diagnostic tool that helps determine if the lymphocyte population is homogeneous (suggesting neoplasia) or heterogeneous. It identifies specific lymphocyte subtypes by detecting cell surface proteins and markers. The minimum panel typically includes markers for T-cells (CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8), B-cells (CD21, CD22), and CD34 for immature cells [2].

For cases where flow cytometry and cytology are inconclusive, PCR for antigen receptor rearrangements (PARR) may be used to test for clonality [2]. Additional diagnostic steps include screening for infectious causes like Ehrlichia canis, particularly in dogs. Basic lab work to check for endocrine disorders like hypoadrenocorticism should be considered [1].

For young animals under 6 months, mild lymphocytosis is often due to vaccination or exposure to novel antigens and may not require extensive diagnostics [1]. However, moderate to marked lymphocytosis, especially in adult animals, warrants a complete diagnostic workup to determine if neoplasia or other serious conditions are present [2].

## Treatment Options

Treatment approaches for lymphocytosis in pets typically depend on identifying and addressing the underlying cause. The primary treatment strategy involves monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy, which has emerged as a cornerstone therapeutic option [1]. These mAb treatments work by targeting specific proteins or cells involved in the immune response, helping to regulate abnormal lymphocyte levels.

Currently, there are five approved monoclonal antibodies available in the veterinary market for various conditions [1]. While not all are specifically indicated for lymphocytosis, they demonstrate the growing role of targeted immunotherapy in veterinary medicine. The specific treatment protocol must be tailored to each patient based on the cause and severity of their condition.

In some cases, supportive care may be necessary alongside primary treatment. This can include monitoring blood cell counts, managing any concurrent infections, and providing appropriate nutrition. The veterinarian will determine the most appropriate treatment approach after conducting a thorough diagnostic evaluation.

Regular monitoring is essential during treatment to assess the response and adjust the therapeutic strategy as needed. Treatment duration varies depending on the underlying cause and the pet's response to therapy.

## Preventive Measures

For lymphocytosis management, preventive measures primarily focus on addressing underlying causes and supporting immune system health [1]. Since viral infections like feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) can trigger lymphocytosis, vaccination plays a critical role in prevention, especially in multi-cat environments. For cats at risk, passive immunization using anti-FPV serum from recovered cats or commercial immune serum products can provide immediate protection [2].

Environmental management is also crucial, particularly in multi-cat households or shelters where infectious diseases can spread rapidly. This includes proper isolation of sick animals, maintaining good hygiene practices, and using appropriate disinfectants in cat living areas. When dealing with viral infections that can cause lymphocytosis, affected cats should be isolated to prevent transmission to other susceptible animals [1,2].

Regular veterinary check-ups and blood work monitoring can help detect early signs of lymphocytosis and identify underlying conditions before they become severe. For breeds predisposed to certain forms of lymphocytic disorders, such as Golden Retrievers and German Shepherd dogs, more frequent monitoring may be recommended [1].

## Differential Diagnosis

Several conditions can present with symptoms similar to lymphocytosis in pets. In dogs and cats under 6 months of age, mild lymphocytosis may occur naturally due to vaccination or exposure to new antigens, making this an important differential to consider [1].

Key differentials include immune-mediated diseases, though these are rare. For example, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia in cats can present with lymphocytosis. Infectious diseases, particularly Ehrlichia canis infection in dogs, commonly cause lymphocytosis. Other infectious agents like Leishmania infantum, Spirocerca lupi, and FIV should also be considered [1].

Endocrine disorders can mimic lymphocytosis. In cats, hyperthyroidism may cause mild lymphocytosis either before diagnosis or secondary to methimazole treatment. In dogs, hypoadrenocorticism (Addison's disease) is an important differential, characterized by lack of a stress leukogram in sick patients [1].

Various neoplastic conditions must be ruled out, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (with or without small cell lymphoma), and non-lymphoid neoplasms like thymoma. Additionally, physiologic causes like epinephrine response, particularly in cats, can transiently elevate lymphocyte counts [1].
