## Disease Overview

Neutrophilia is defined as an increase in the absolute numbers of circulating neutrophils above the normal reference range. In adult dogs and cats, neutrophil counts exceeding 12,000-13,000/μl are considered neutrophilic [1]. It represents the most common type of leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) in pets.

Neutrophils serve as the primary defense against invading microorganisms in tissues. They are produced continuously in the bone marrow, released into blood where they circulate briefly (about 10 hours), before migrating into tissue spaces or epithelial surfaces [1]. In dogs, neutrophils are equally distributed between circulating and marginal pools in a 1:1 ratio, while cats have a 1:3 ratio [1].

Several conditions can lead to neutrophilia, including bacterial infections, inflammation, corticosteroid administration, and stress [1,5]. The severity and underlying cause can be evaluated through blood tests and examination of neutrophil morphology. Toxic changes in neutrophils, such as cytoplasmic basophilia and vacuolation, often indicate severe inflammatory disease or bacterial infection [1]. In some cases, extreme neutrophilia (>50,000/μl) can occur with chronic suppurative conditions or certain neoplasms, termed a "leukemoid response" [1].

Based on the source material, I'll write a section about the common pathogens that cause neutrophilia in pets.

## Common Pathogens

Bacterial and viral infections are major causes of neutrophilia in pets. For bacterial infections, common pathogens include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis [1]. These bacteria can trigger a significant inflammatory response leading to increased neutrophil production and release from bone marrow into circulation.

For viral infections, influenza A virus (IAV) is a notable pathogen that causes neutrophilia through multiple mechanisms. During IAV infection, neutrophils migrate to the respiratory tract in two distinct waves - an initial surge within 24 hours followed by a second wave that increases until disease resolution or death [2]. The virus triggers the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines like IL-6, CXCL8, and CCL2, which stimulate neutrophil production and recruitment to infection sites [2].

The severity of neutrophilia often correlates with pathogen virulence and disease severity. For example, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses can cause severe neutrophilic inflammation in the lungs along with systemic spread of infection [2]. The presence of toxic changes in neutrophils, such as toxic granulations, vacuolization, and Döhle bodies, can help confirm bacterial infections and indicate their severity [1].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Neutrophilia presents with several observable clinical symptoms and signs. The most common indicators include fever, lethargy, and decreased appetite [1]. Dogs may also show vomiting, diarrhea, pale gums, bruising, and lameness [4]. In severe cases of inflammation or infection, the animal may appear visibly weak and quiet with pale mucous membranes [1].

Physical examination findings can include palpable abnormalities like liver enlargement or abdominal masses depending on the underlying cause [1]. Toxic changes in the neutrophils, visible on blood smears, often accompany serious infections and inflammatory conditions [2]. These toxic changes indicate accelerated production of neutrophils in the bone marrow in response to severe inflammation [5].

The severity of symptoms generally correlates with the degree of neutrophilia and any associated left shift (presence of immature neutrophils) [1,3]. Dogs with mild cases may show minimal clinical signs, while those with marked neutrophilia, especially when combined with toxic changes, typically appear more systemically ill [1,2].

Based on the source material, I'll write a section on diagnostic methods for neutrophilia in pets.

## Diagnostic Methods

The diagnosis of neutrophilia involves both clinical presentation and laboratory testing. Primary clinical signs that may indicate neutrophilia include inflammation, infection, and stress-related symptoms [1]. The main diagnostic tool is a complete blood count (CBC) with differential leukocyte count to determine absolute neutrophil numbers [2].

Blood smear examination is essential for detecting morphological changes in neutrophils that help confirm infection and inflammation. Key microscopic findings include toxic changes like cytoplasmic basophilia, Döhle bodies, toxic granulations, vacuoles, and nuclear changes [3]. These toxic changes in neutrophils can be more reliable indicators of infection than just neutrophil counts alone.

Additional diagnostic methods include bone marrow biopsy, flow cytometry, and molecular/genetic testing when the underlying cause needs to be determined [1]. The diagnostic workup should also include evaluation of concurrent symptoms and relevant blood chemistry tests to help identify the specific condition causing the neutrophilia. Regular monitoring through serial CBCs may be needed to track response to treatment [2].

Based on the source material, I'll write a comprehensive section on treatment options for neutrophilia.

## Treatment Options 

Treatment of neutrophilia focuses on managing both the underlying condition and any complications while providing appropriate supportive care. For neutropenic patients receiving chemotherapy, treatment approaches vary based on severity. Asymptomatic patients with neutrophil counts above 750/μL can typically be managed on an outpatient basis with oral broad-spectrum antibiotics [4]. 

For patients with febrile neutropenia or severe neutropenia (<750/μL), hospitalization is required with more intensive interventions including:
- Intravenous fluid therapy
- Injectable broad-spectrum antibiotics (typically ampicillin-sulbactam and enrofloxacin)
- Anti-nausea medications like maropitant and ondansetron
- GI protectants as needed [2,4]

Supportive nursing care is essential and includes:
- Regular monitoring of vital signs and temperature 
- Maintaining clean, low-traffic hospital environments to prevent infection
- Administering prescribed medications on schedule
- Monitoring food and water intake [4]

Most patients respond well to treatment within 24-48 hours with appropriate supportive care. For chemotherapy patients, future drug doses may need to be reduced by 10-25% if severe neutropenia occurs. Ongoing monitoring with regular CBCs is important to track recovery of neutrophil counts [4].

Here is my suggested section on preventive measures for neutrophilia:

## Preventive Measures

The key to preventing neutrophilia lies in a comprehensive vaccination program and proper environmental management. Vaccines are one of the most effective tools for preventing infectious diseases that can trigger neutrophilia [1]. Core vaccines should be administered according to established protocols, with initial doses starting in young animals followed by appropriate boosters. However, vaccines must be given thoughtfully, as adverse reactions can occur in some patients [3].

Environmental management is also critical for disease prevention. This includes maintaining proper hygiene, avoiding exposure to infected animals, and controlling stress levels that can impact immune function [1]. For facilities housing multiple animals, biosecurity procedures like proper cleaning/disinfection and population density control are essential to reduce disease transmission [1].

Any vaccination protocol should be individualized based on the animal's age, health status, lifestyle and risk factors [4]. Regular wellness exams allow veterinarians to assess disease risk and update preventive care recommendations. The vaccination visit provides an opportunity for thorough physical examination and client education about disease prevention strategies [4].

Based on the source material, I'll write the Differential Diagnosis section for neutrophilia in pets:

## Differential Diagnosis

Several conditions need to be distinguished from neutrophilia, as they can present with similar changes in white blood cell counts. Stress or corticosteroid-induced responses must be differentiated, as these commonly cause mature neutrophilia without a left shift or toxic changes. Physiologic neutrophilia from excitement or exercise (epinephrine response) should also be ruled out, as this can temporarily double white blood cell counts within minutes [1].

Inflammatory conditions need careful differentiation, as they produce variable neutrophil responses depending on the stage and severity. Acute severe inflammation can paradoxically cause neutropenia with a left shift if tissue demand exceeds bone marrow production. Chronic inflammation typically shows higher neutrophilia with toxic changes [1,2].

Primary hematopoietic neoplasias like chronic myeloid leukemia, essential thrombocythemia, and chronic neutrophilic leukemia must be distinguished, as they can cause persistent neutrophilia [2]. Myeloproliferative disorders should be considered, especially with concurrent abnormalities in other cell lines [3].

Non-neoplastic causes that require differentiation include factitious neutrophilia from inadequate blood anticoagulation or cryoglobulin precipitation, as well as genetic conditions like chronic idiopathic leukocytosis [2].
