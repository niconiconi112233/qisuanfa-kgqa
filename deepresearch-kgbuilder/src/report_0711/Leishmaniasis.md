## Disease Overview

Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by protozoa of the genus *Leishmania*. There are several species of *Leishmania* that can infect dogs, cats, and other mammals, with *Leishmania infantum* being the most common in dogs and cats.

Leishmaniasis is endemic in many regions around the world, including the Mediterranean basin, South America, and parts of Asia. Dogs are considered the main reservoir hosts for *L. infantum*, but cats can also become infected and may play a role in the epidemiology of the disease.

The transmission of *Leishmania* occurs primarily through the bite of infected female sand flies. Sand flies ingest amastigote forms of the parasite when taking a blood meal from an infected host, and the parasites then transform into promastigotes and migrate to the fly's proboscis, ready to be transmitted to the next host. Cats can become infected through these sand fly bites, and there is also some evidence that vertical (mother-to-offspring) transmission can occur. 

The relationship between the *Leishmania* parasite and the host's immune system is complex. Protective immunity is associated with a Th1-mediated cellular immune response, while susceptibility is linked to a predominant Th2-mediated humoral response. Cats appear to have a higher degree of resistance to *L. infantum* infection compared to dogs, but the details of feline immunity are not fully understood.

In summary, this report provides a high-level overview of leishmaniasis, including the definition of the disease and its epidemiological background. The key points are:

- Leishmaniasis is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus *Leishmania*
- *Leishmania infantum* is the main species affecting dogs and cats
- Transmission occurs primarily through the bite of infected sand flies
- Cats can become infected but appear more resistant than dogs
- The immune response plays a critical role in determining disease progression

## Common Pathogens

The main causative agent of leishmaniasis in companion animals is the protozoan parasite *Leishmania infantum*. Dogs are the primary reservoir host for this parasite [1]. While cats, horses, and other mammals can also be infected, the majority of clinical cases are reported in dogs [2]. 

Other *Leishmania* species, such as *L. braziliensis*, can also cause mucocutaneous leishmaniasis in dogs [1]. However, *L. infantum* is the most widespread and important causative agent of leishmaniasis in companion animals.

The life cycle of *L. infantum* involves two hosts - sand flies, which act as the vector, and mammalian hosts like dogs [3]. When female sand flies take a blood meal, they can ingest infected macrophages containing the intracellular amastigote form of the parasite. These amastigotes then transform into the extracellular promastigote form in the sand fly's digestive tract. The promastigotes migrate to the sand fly's proboscis and are then transmitted to a new mammalian host during the next blood meal [3].

In dogs, *L. infantum* primarily causes a multisystemic visceral disease, though cutaneous and mucosal forms can also occur [1,2]. The wide range of clinical signs reflects the parasite's ability to disseminate and infect various tissues and organs, including the skin, lymph nodes, kidneys, liver, spleen, and bone marrow [9].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Leishmaniasis in dogs can cause a wide range of clinical signs, with skin lesions being the most common presentation. The main clinical signs include [1]:

- Enlargement of the lymph nodes: This is one of the most common clinical signs of canine leishmaniasis.

- Skin lesions: These are the most frequent presentation and can include exfoliative dermatitis with white, sticky scales initially on the face and ears, ulcerative dermatitis on bony prominences, onychogryphosis (excessive nail growth), persistent papular dermatitis, and less common forms like pustular dermatitis and multifocal alopecia. [2]

- Systemic signs: These can include pale mucous membranes, weight loss, exercise intolerance, lethargy, polyuria/polydipsia, epistaxis, vomiting, diarrhea, and lameness. [1]

- Ocular signs: Blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis, and anterior uveitis can also occur. [1]

The clinical presentation can vary widely, ranging from subclinical infection to severe systemic disease. Factors like the dog's age, breed, immune status, and presence of concurrent diseases can influence the progression and severity of leishmaniasis. [1,3]

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosing leishmaniasis in dogs requires an integrated approach that includes both clinicopathological evaluation and specific laboratory tests [1]. The main diagnostic methods for leishmaniasis in dogs are:

Clinicopathological findings: Typical clinical signs of leishmaniasis include skin lesions, ocular abnormalities, lameness, weight loss, fever, and organ dysfunction. Clinicopathological abnormalities may include nonregenerative anemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperglobulinemia, proteinuria, and azotemia [1].

Serological testing: Quantitative serological tests such as immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and ELISA are the most sensitive for diagnosing leishmaniasis, especially when compatible clinical signs are present [1,2]. These tests detect anti-Leishmania antibodies. Serological cross-reactivity with other trypanosomes can occur in some regions [1].

Cytological/histological examination: Leishmania amastigotes can be detected through cytological evaluation of aspirates from lymph nodes, spleen, skin lesions, or other affected tissues [1,18]. Identification of the parasites in tissue sections can also support the diagnosis.

PCR assay: Molecular detection of Leishmania DNA through PCR tests on blood, tissues, or other samples enables sensitive and specific diagnosis of infection [1,19]. PCR is particularly useful for detecting infection in subclinical dogs.

In summary, the diagnosis of canine leishmaniasis requires a combination of clinical signs, clinicopathological abnormalities, and specific laboratory tests such as serology and PCR. Identifying Leishmania amastigotes through cytology or histology can also confirm the diagnosis. [1,2]

## Treatment Options

The main treatment options for leishmaniasis in dogs include antiprotozoal medications, immunotherapy, and supportive care.

Antiprotozoal agents commonly used include N-methylglucamine antimoniate (50-100 mg/kg SC every 24 hours for 4-6 weeks), miltefosine (2 mg/kg PO every 12 hours for 28 days) combined with allopurinol (10 mg/kg PO every 12 hours for 6-12 months), and allopurinol alone (10 mg/kg PO every 12 hours for 6-12 months). These medications can inhibit parasite metabolism and cause cell death, but recrudescence and relapse are common after treatment stops [1,2].

Immunotherapeutic drugs like domperidone (0.5 mg/kg PO every 24 hours for 4 weeks) can also be used to enhance the dog's immune response against Leishmania infection [3]. Dietary supplements like active hexose correlated compound may also help boost immunity in infected dogs.

Supportive treatments include intravenous fluids, special therapeutic diets, and antibiotics if skin lesions are infected. However, treated dogs may still harbor the parasite and remain infectious to sand flies, so stopping treatment needs to be carefully considered [4].

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is a crucial preventive measure against canine leishmaniasis. Four vaccines have been commercially approved for use in dogs: Leishmune® and Leish-Tec® in Brazil, and CaniLeish® and LetiFend® in Europe [1]. These vaccines have demonstrated safety and immunogenicity in dogs, eliciting both humoral and cellular immune responses against Leishmania parasites.

Studies have shown that the live attenuated *Leishmania major* Centrin gene-deleted (*Lm*Cen−/−) vaccine can provide long-term protection against canine visceral leishmaniasis. When administered intradermally, the *Lm*Cen−/− vaccine induced high levels of IgG antibodies and stimulated IFN-γ production by CD4+ T cells in dogs [2]. Furthermore, in a field trial, vaccinated dogs exposed to natural Leishmania transmission in an endemic area exhibited an 82.5% reduction in the incidence of symptomatic disease compared to unvaccinated controls [2].

In addition to vaccination, environmental management strategies can help reduce the risk of canine leishmaniasis. These include the use of topical insecticides to protect dogs from sand fly bites, as well as the control of reservoir hosts, such as reducing stray dog populations in endemic areas [3].

## Differential Diagnosis

Based on the provided information, the main differential diagnoses for this case include:

1. Leishmaniasis: The history of the dog being imported from China, along with the clinical signs of skin lesions, lymphadenomegaly, polyarthritis, and laboratory abnormalities like anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperglobulinemia are highly suggestive of leishmaniasis. This is supported by the positive serology and response to anti-leishmaniasis treatment.

2. Immune-mediated polyarthritis: The dog's presentation with fever, painful joints, and lack of response to initial treatment could indicate an underlying immune-mediated condition.

3. Bacterial or fungal skin infections: The papulo-pustular dermatitis could be secondary to a bacterial or fungal skin infection.

4. Other systemic diseases: Conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus, ehrlichiosis, or immune-mediated glomerulonephritis should also be considered in the differential diagnosis given the multisystemic nature of the presentation.
