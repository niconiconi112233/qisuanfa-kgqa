## Disease Overview

Pelodera Dermatitis is a rare, acute skin condition caused by the invasion of skin by larvae of the free-living nematode Pelodera strongyloides. These larvae are ubiquitous in decaying organic matter and moist soil, but only occasionally become parasitic.[1] Animals are exposed to the larvae through direct contact with infested materials such as damp, dirty bedding.[2,3] Preexisting skin conditions or environmental factors that compromise the skin's integrity can facilitate the larvae's ability to invade.[3] 

Pelodera dermatitis has been reported in dogs, cattle, horses, sheep, guinea pigs, and humans.[3] The lesions typically affect areas of the body that come into contact with the contaminated environment, such as the legs, abdomen, and groin.[2,3] Clinical signs include erythema, partial to complete alopecia, papules, pustules, crusts, erosions, and ulcerations.[3] Pruritus is often intense but can also be moderate or absent.[3] A definitive diagnosis is made by identifying the characteristic rhabditiform larvae in deep skin scrapings.[3]

Treatment primarily involves removing the animal from the source of infection and improving environmental conditions. Dipping or spraying affected animals with insecticides may also be helpful. In severe cases, short-term use of corticosteroids can provide relief for pruritus.[3]

## Common Pathogens

Pelodera Dermatitis, also known as rhabditic dermatitis, is caused by the larvae of the free-living nematode _Pelodera (Rhabditis) strongyloides_ [1]. This parasite is ubiquitous in decaying organic matter and moist soil, and animals can become infected through direct contact with infested materials like damp bedding [1,2].

The condition is characterized by a pruritic, erythematous, and alopecic dermatitis, often localized to areas in contact with the ground [1,3]. Diagnosis is typically made by identifying the distinctive rhabditiform larvae in skin scrapings [1,4]. Differential diagnoses include other nematode infestations like hookworm dermatitis and strongyloidiasis [1,3].

Treatment primarily involves removing the animal from the contaminated environment and improving husbandry conditions. Topical or systemic antiparasitic medications may also be used in some cases [1,3,4].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Pelodera dermatitis is a rare, non-seasonal, acute dermatosis that results from invasion of the skin by larvae of the free-living saprophytic nematode Pelodera (syn. Rhabditis) strongyloides [1]. Animals are exposed to the larvae through direct contact with infested material such as damp, filthy bedding [1,2].

The typical clinical presentation of Pelodera dermatitis includes erythematous, partially to completely alopecic skin lesions with papules, pustules, crusts, erosions, or ulcerations, usually confined to body areas in contact with the infested material such as the extremities, ventral abdomen and thorax, and perineum [1,3,4]. Pruritus is usually intense but can also be moderate or absent [1,3]. 

Differential diagnoses include other parasitic skin conditions such as demodicosis, canine scabies, dermatophytosis, and hookworm dermatitis [1].

## Diagnostic Methods

Pelodera Dermatitis is typically diagnosed through a combination of clinical presentation, laboratory testing, and other diagnostic approaches.

The key features of the clinical presentation include a pruritic, erythematous, and alopecic dermatitis that is often confined to areas in contact with the ground, such as the extremities, ventral abdomen and thorax, and perineum [1]. Differential diagnoses include other parasitic infestations, bacterial infections, and other skin conditions.

Definitive diagnosis is usually made by finding live, motile Pelodera (Rhabditis) strongyloides larvae in skin scrapings [1,2]. These larvae have a rhabditiform esophagus that can help differentiate them from other nematode larvae like hookworms [2]. Skin biopsies may also reveal larvae within the hair follicles and superficial dermis, along with an inflammatory dermal infiltrate [1].

Culturing the larvae on blood agar at 25°C can also aid in diagnosis, as the larvae will develop into adult worms [1]. However, seeking the parasites in the environment is generally unrewarding, as it is difficult to distinguish Pelodera from other free-living nematodes [3].

In summary, the combination of characteristic clinical signs, identification of larvae in skin scrapings, and sometimes skin biopsies or larval culture are the main diagnostic methods for Pelodera Dermatitis. Removal of the animal from the contaminated environment is often the first step in successful treatment.

## Treatment Options

The primary treatment for Pelodera Dermatitis involves removing the dog from the source of the infection and providing a clean, dry environment. This involves discarding any infested bedding material and thoroughly disinfecting the dog's living area [1,2].

In milder cases, this environmental management alone may lead to spontaneous recovery [1,2]. However, topical or systemic insecticidal treatments may be used if the skin lesions are severe or if pruritus is intense [1,3]. Short-term corticosteroid therapy can also be helpful for managing inflammation and pruritus [1,3].

Antibiotics may be necessary if there are secondary bacterial infections present [1,2]. In these cases, the veterinarian will likely prescribe an appropriate antibiotic based on culture and sensitivity testing.

## Preventive Measures

The first step in preventing Pelodera dermatitis is to maintain a clean and dry environment for the animals. Discarding moist or dirty bedding and replacing it with clean, dry bedding is crucial.[1] Ensuring proper hygiene and sanitation can help eliminate the source of infection, as the larvae thrive in damp, unsanitary conditions.

Additionally, keeping the animal's living area well-ventilated and avoiding areas with decaying organic matter can reduce the risk of exposure to the Pelodera strongyloides larvae.[2] If an outbreak occurs, affected animals should be isolated from the contaminated environment and moved to a clean, dry location to prevent further spread of the infection.

While the use of anti-parasitic treatments is generally not necessary, some veterinarians have found that ivermectin can be helpful in certain cases.[3] However, the primary focus should be on environmental management and good husbandry practices to prevent and control Pelodera dermatitis.

## Differential Diagnosis

Pelodera dermatitis can be difficult to distinguish from several other canine skin conditions with similar clinical presentations. The key differential diagnoses include:

[1] Hookworm dermatitis: Caused by Ancylostoma or Uncinaria species, this condition also results in pruritic, erythematous lesions on the distal limbs, feet, and ventrum due to larval migration through the skin. Hookworm larvae can be differentiated from Pelodera larvae by their lack of a rhabditiform esophagus.[1,2]

[2] Demodicosis: This mite infestation causes localized or generalized alopecia, crusting, and folliculitis. Demodex mites are larger (40-300 μm) than Pelodera larvae and reside within hair follicles and sebaceous glands, rather than just the follicular lumen.[2,3]

[3] Sarcoptic mange: Sarcoptic mange, caused by Sarcoptes scabiei, results in pruritic, crusting dermatitis, most commonly on the ears, elbows, and hocks. Sarcoptes mites (200-400 μm) live within the stratum corneum, unlike the intrafollicular Pelodera larvae.[2,3]

[4] Superficial bacterial folliculitis: This condition presents with papules, pustules, and crusts, similar to Pelodera dermatitis, but lacks the presence of nematode larvae.[2]

[5] Dermatophytosis: Fungal skin infections can cause alopecia, erythema, and scaling, but do not involve intrafollicular parasites.[2]

In addition to the clinical signs, definitive diagnosis of Pelodera dermatitis requires identification of the characteristic rhabditiform larvae in skin scrapings or biopsies. Histopathology can further confirm the presence of the nematodes within hair follicles and the associated eosinophilic and pyogranulomatous inflammation.[1,2,3,4]

# Pet disease: Pelodera Dermatitis

Pelodera Dermatitis is a rare, acute skin condition caused by the invasion of skin by larvae of the free-living nematode Pelodera strongyloides. Animals are exposed through contact with infested organic matter or damp bedding. The characteristic clinical signs include erythema, alopecia, papules, pustules, and intense pruritus. Definitive diagnosis requires identification of the distinctive rhabditiform larvae in skin scrapings. Treatment focuses on removing the animal from the contaminated environment and improving husbandry practices, with possible use of topical or systemic antiparasitic medications.

## Conclusion

Pelodera Dermatitis is an uncommon but important parasitic skin condition that veterinarians should be aware of, especially in cases of pruritic, erosive dermatitis in dogs and other animals. Prompt diagnosis through skin scrapings and proper environmental management are key to successful treatment. While rare, this disease serves as a reminder of the potential for free-living nematodes to opportunistically infect animal hosts when suitable conditions arise.
