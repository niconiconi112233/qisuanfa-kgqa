## Disease Overview

Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a significant viral pathogen that causes upper respiratory tract and oral diseases in cats. It belongs to the family Caliciviridae, genus Vesivirus, and is a positive-sense, single-stranded, non-enveloped RNA virus. 

FCV exhibits high genetic diversity and variability, contributing to a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. Prevalence rates can be high, particularly in multi-cat environments, where FCV can circulate readily due to the development of persistent carrier states in some cats following recovery from acute infection.

The epidemiological data shows:

- FCV prevalence rates ranging from 46.7% to 65.8% in cat populations surveyed in Thailand, with co-detection of FCV and feline herpesvirus-1 at 31.5%. 

- FCV prevalence is generally higher in larger multi-cat groups compared to smaller household cat populations.

- Some cats appear resistant to FCV infection even with continuous exposure, likely due to immune-mediated or genetic factors.

- FCV can persist in the environment for extended periods, posing a risk for indirect transmission in high-turnover settings like shelters and veterinary clinics.

In summary, FCV is a widespread and genetically diverse viral pathogen that causes significant respiratory and oral disease in cats, with the potential for severe systemic manifestations in some cases. Its ability to establish persistent carrier states contributes to continued circulation within cat populations.

## Common Pathogens

Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a highly contagious viral infection that is one of the major causes of upper respiratory infections in cats, along with feline herpesvirus-1 (FeHV-1) [1]. FCV belongs to the Vesivirus genus of the Caliciviridae family, and is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. 

In addition to FCV, other pathogens involved in the feline respiratory disease complex include:

- Feline herpesvirus-1 (FeHV-1): Also known as feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR), FeHV-1 accounts for the majority of acute upper respiratory infections in cats and primarily affects the eyes and nose [2].

- Chlamydia felis and Chlamydia psittaci: These bacterial infections can cause conjunctivitis, sneezing, eye discharge, and fever, though they are less important than FCV and FeHV-1 [2]. 

- Mycoplasma infections: These can lead to conjunctivitis and rhinitis, but are also less common than the viral infections [2].

- Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus: May cause mild upper respiratory signs, but usually leads to more systemic illness [2].

- Reoviruses: Can replicate in the respiratory tract but may not always cause respiratory symptoms [2].

In summary, the two primary viral causes of feline upper respiratory infections are FCV and FeHV-1, while other bacterial and viral agents play a lesser role. The clinical signs of these infections can overlap, requiring diagnostic testing to differentiate the causative agent.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Feline calicivirus (FCV) can cause a range of clinical symptoms in infected cats, from mild to severe. The most common symptoms include:

- Sneezing, nasal discharge, and nasal congestion [1]
- Conjunctivitis (eye inflammation) and eye discharge [1] 
- Oral ulcers on the lips, tongue, or elsewhere in the mouth, often accompanied by drooling [1,2]
- Fever, lethargy, and poor appetite due to nasal congestion and oral ulcers [1]

In more severe cases, cats may also develop:

- Pneumonia with cough or difficulty breathing [1]
- Joint inflammation causing limping or swelling [1,2]
- Systemic signs like swelling in the face/legs, skin wounds, bloody nose or stool, due to inflammation of blood vessel walls (vasculitis) [2]

These severe manifestations are associated with certain mutant strains of FCV that can cause virulent systemic disease (FCV-VSD), which can be fatal in up to 60% of affected cats [1,2].

## Diagnostic Methods

Feline calicivirus (FCV) infection can be diagnosed through a combination of clinical presentation, laboratory testing, and imaging.

Veterinarians will typically examine the cat for symptoms commonly associated with FCV, such as sneezing, nasal discharge, oral ulcers, and fever. In most cases, a definitive diagnosis is not necessary as these infections are common and will resolve with supportive treatment.

However, if multiple cats are affected or the cats are housed with others, the veterinarian may take swabs from the eyes, nose, or mouth to test for the presence of the virus. Diagnostic laboratories can detect FCV using two main methods:

1. [1] Growing the virus in cell culture, which can take days to weeks.
2. [2] Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), which detects the genetic material of the virus and provides faster results.

Interpreting test results can be challenging, as many healthy cats may test positive due to prior exposure or recent vaccination with a modified live virus vaccine. A negative result does not necessarily rule out FCV infection, especially if the cat is sampled more than a week after symptom onset. 

Commercial testing cannot distinguish between mild strains of FCV and the more virulent strains that can cause severe systemic disease. In these cases, additional laboratory analysis may be required.

Chest radiographs may be recommended if the cat presents with respiratory symptoms, but the findings will not be specific for FCV infection. Pneumonia can be diagnosed using X-rays.

## Treatment Options

Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment for cats with feline calicivirus (FCV) infection. This includes:

[1] Placing the cat in a warm, steamy bathroom for 10-15 minutes twice daily to help reduce nasal congestion. 

[2] Offering a variety of strong-smelling foods, as affected cats may have a poor appetite due to nasal congestion and oral ulcers. Warming canned food slightly can make it more enticing.

[3] Using warm, wet cloths to clean away eye and nose discharge, as infected cats may not groom themselves effectively.

Medications that may be used include:

[4] Pain medication to provide comfort for cats with oral/nasal ulcerations. 

[5] Oral antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections of the nose, lungs, or mouth.

[6] Topical eye antibiotics for eye infections.

[7] Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce inflammation and fever.

[8] Intravenous or subcutaneous fluids if the cat is dehydrated.

Most cats recover in 7-10 days, but can become chronic carriers that continue shedding the virus. Vaccination helps prevent severe disease, but does not necessarily prevent infection. Thorough disinfection of the environment is important to control spread.

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is a crucial preventive measure for feline calicivirus (FCV) infection. Cats should receive a vaccine every three to four weeks starting at 6-8 weeks of age, with a final booster given after 16 weeks of age [1]. Boosters should be given every three years, or annually for cats in high-risk, multi-cat environments [1].

In addition to vaccination, good hygiene and disinfection practices are essential for controlling FCV spread, especially in shelters, catteries, and veterinary clinics [1]. The virus can survive on surfaces for up to a month, so thorough cleaning and disinfection of food and water bowls, litter boxes, and other contaminated items is necessary [1]. Disinfectants effective against FCV include sodium hypochlorite, accelerated hydrogen peroxide, aldehydes, and potassium peroxymonosulfate [2].

Isolating infected cats and quarantining new cats for 1-2 weeks can also help prevent transmission within a household [1]. Owners should be aware that cats that have recovered from FCV may still be carriers and shed the virus intermittently, so continued vaccination is recommended even for these animals [1].

## Differential Diagnosis

Feline calicivirus (FCV) is one of the primary causes of upper respiratory infections in cats, along with feline herpesvirus (FHV-1). Other diseases that can present with similar symptoms to FCV infection include:

[1] Infections with bacteria such as Chlamydia felis and Mycoplasma felis. These bacteria can also cause respiratory disease in cats, often with conjunctivitis, sneezing, and nasal discharge. [1]

[2] Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) may cause mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, though it typically leads to more systemic illness. [1] 

[3] Reoviruses can also replicate in the respiratory tract, though they may not always cause respiratory signs. [1]

In summary, while FCV is one of the most common causes of feline upper respiratory infections, veterinarians must consider other viral and bacterial pathogens that can produce similar clinical presentations. Diagnostic testing is often needed to definitively identify the underlying cause.
