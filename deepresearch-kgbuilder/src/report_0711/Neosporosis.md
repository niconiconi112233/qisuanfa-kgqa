## Disease Overview

Neosporosis is an important neuromuscular disease caused by the protozoan parasite Neospora caninum. The disease primarily affects dogs and cattle worldwide. [1]

Neospora caninum has an indirect life cycle, with dogs and wild canids serving as definitive hosts that shed infectious oocysts in their feces. Herbivores like cattle are common intermediate hosts that can become infected by ingesting the oocysts. [2] Neosporosis is the leading cause of abortion and stillbirths in cattle, as well as neuromuscular disorders in dogs. [3]

Two main forms of neosporosis have been described:

1. Juvenile form (<6 months): Characterized by rigid extension and muscle atrophy of the hindlimbs, often progressing to muscle contractures, arthrogryposis, and death from cervical weakness and dysphagia. This is most common in congenitally infected puppies. [4]

2. Adult form: Can result from new infection or reactivation of latent infection. Manifests as necrotizing cerebellitis, multifocal CNS signs, or polymyositis. Other signs like myocarditis, dermatitis, and pneumonia have also been reported. [4]

Diagnosis typically involves a combination of history, clinical signs, serology, histopathology, and PCR assays. Treatment is challenging, often with only partial or temporary response. Preventing exposure to sources of infection, like contaminated water or tissues from intermediate hosts, is key for control. Neosporosis has not been clearly associated with human disease. [4]

## Common Pathogens

Neosporosis in dogs is caused by the protozoan parasite _Neospora caninum_. This intracellular parasite has a complex life cycle involving definitive canine hosts and intermediate herbivore hosts, most notably cattle [1,2].

The main stages of the _N. caninum_ life cycle are:

- Oocysts: Environmental stages that form in the intestinal epithelium of canine hosts and are shed in feces [1,2]. 
- Tachyzoites: Rapidly dividing asexual stages that actively invade host tissues during the acute phase of infection [1,2].
- Bradyzoites: Slowly dividing encysted stages found in host tissues [1,2].

Domestic dogs and wild canids like coyotes and wolves serve as definitive hosts, while cattle, sheep, goats, horses, deer, and other animals can act as intermediate hosts [1,2]. Transmission to dogs primarily occurs through ingestion of infected tissues from intermediate hosts, particularly bovine placenta and fetal membranes [1,2].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Dogs affected with neosporosis often present with concurrent neurological and ophthalmological signs. Common neurological signs include seizures, cranial nerve deficits, and cerebellar and neuromuscular dysfunction such as progressive muscle weakness, rigidity, and atrophy. [1,2] 

In young puppies, the most severe form of neosporosis is characterized by rigid extension and paralysis of the hindlimbs, which can progress to contracture of the muscles, arthrogryposis, and joint deformities. Puppies may also develop cervical weakness and dysphagia, ultimately leading to death. [1,2]

In adult dogs, neosporosis more commonly causes a necrotizing cerebellitis with cerebellar atrophy and multifocal central nervous system signs, or polymyositis. Other manifestations that have been reported include myocarditis, dermatitis, and pneumonia. [1,2]

Overall, the prognosis for dogs with neosporosis is guarded, as neurological signs may not fully resolve even with treatment due to irreversible pathological changes caused by the infection. However, adult dogs generally have a better outcome compared to young puppies. [1,2]

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosis of neosporosis in dogs can be challenging. Relevant historical information (e.g., access to bovine placental tissue) and clinical findings help to identify suspected cases. 

Consultation with a clinical pathologist or parasitologist at a diagnostic laboratory might be helpful in creating a plan to confirm suspected cases of _N. caninum_ infection. Testing for _T. gondii_ infection can be beneficial because the clinical signs are similar and there could be a concurrent infection.

If _N. caninum_ infection is suspected, histological examination of muscle tissue samples might demonstrate protozoal organisms. Immunohistochemistry could be needed to confirm the diagnosis. PCR assay and serological testing (_Neospora_ indirect fluorescent antibody test [IFAT] or ELISA) can also confirm the diagnosis.[1][2]

### Key Points
- Histological examination, PCR, and serology (IFAT, ELISA) are the main diagnostic methods for neosporosis in dogs
- Histological examination can detect protozoal organisms, but immunohistochemistry may be required for confirmation
- Serology is useful, but a single positive antibody titer does not establish a definitive diagnosis; a fourfold increase in titers over 3-4 weeks is supportive of active infection
- Testing for concurrent _T. gondii_ infection may also be warranted due to similar clinical presentations

## Treatment Options

Several drugs have been used to treat clinical neosporosis in dogs, with varying degrees of success:

- Clindamycin: This antibiotic has shown the most promising results. Long-term clindamycin treatment (12.5-25 mg/kg orally every 12 hours) can help resolve clinical signs, though it does not eliminate tissue cysts [1]. 

- Sulfonamides and pyrimethamine: These drugs may also be used in combination with clindamycin to amplify the antiprotozoal effects [1].

- Other drugs like ormetoprim-sulfadimethoxine, pyrimethamine-sulfaquinoxaline, and sulfadoxine-trimethoprim have shown some promise, but data on their efficacy is limited [3].

The goal of treatment is to resolve clinical signs and slow disease progression, rather than completely eliminate the infection. Treatment is most effective when started early, before irreversible neurological damage has occurred. Prognosis is better in older dogs with more slowly progressing disease.

Supportive care and nursing approaches are also important, such as managing muscle contractures and weakness. Unfortunately, there is no effective way to prevent vertical transmission from dam to offspring, and tissue cysts are not eliminated by current treatments.

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination can be an effective method of preventing neosporosis in animals like cattle and dogs. However, developing a safe and effective vaccine for widespread use remains a technical challenge. [1] Research indicates that live vaccination with tachyzoites of Neospora caninum can provide significant protection against abortion and vertical transmission in sheep. [2] Additionally, a vaccine consisting of recombinant N. caninum proteins cyclophilin and profilin has also been shown to confer partial protection against experimental neosporosis-induced abortion in sheep. [5] 

While vaccination offers promise, controlling the environmental transmission of N. caninum is also important for preventing the spread of infection. Insights from a review of neosporosis cases in dogs suggest that even with treatment, complete clinical recovery is rare, with high rates of relapse. [4] Therefore, a comprehensive prevention strategy focused on both vaccination and environmental management will likely be necessary to effectively control neosporosis in both livestock and companion animals.

## Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating a dog with suspected neosporosis, several other diseases with similar neurological and neuromuscular symptoms should be considered in the differential diagnosis:

[1] Toxoplasmosis - Another protozoal disease caused by _Toxoplasma gondii_ that can also affect the nervous system and muscles in dogs. Serological testing can help distinguish it from neosporosis. 

[2] Canine distemper - A viral disease that targets the nervous system and can cause paralysis, tremors, and muscle spasms. Characteristic lesions and clinical signs help differentiate it from neosporosis.

[3] Intervertebral disc disease - Compressive lesions of the spinal cord can cause progressive ascending paralysis similar to neosporosis. Diagnostic imaging is needed to identify the underlying disc herniation. 

[4] Degenerative myelopathy - A progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to progressive hind limb weakness and paralysis, but without the pronounced muscle rigidity seen in neosporosis.

[5] Polymyositis - An immune-mediated inflammatory muscle disease that can cause weakness and stiffness, but lacks the specific neurological signs of neosporosis.

Careful consideration of the dog's history, clinical presentation, and results of diagnostic tests (e.g. serology, PCR, histopathology) are important to arrive at the correct diagnosis and distinguish neosporosis from these other potential causes of neuromuscular disease in dogs.

# Neosporosis in Companion Animals

Neosporosis is an important parasitic disease that primarily affects dogs and cattle worldwide. Caused by the protozoan parasite Neospora caninum, it can lead to severe neurological and neuromuscular symptoms, often with fatal outcomes. This report synthesizes the latest research on the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of neosporosis in companion animals.

## Conclusion

Neosporosis poses a significant health threat to dogs, with two main forms of the disease - a juvenile form characterized by rigid paralysis, and an adult form causing neurological and muscular dysfunction. While treatment options exist, such as long-term antibiotic therapy, the prognosis remains guarded due to the potential for irreversible damage. 

Prevention is key, though developing an effective vaccine remains a challenge. Environmental management strategies, such as limiting exposure to contaminated tissues, are crucial. Careful differential diagnosis is also important, as neosporosis can be mistaken for other neurological diseases.

Moving forward, continued research into improved diagnostic methods, more effective treatments, and viable vaccination approaches will be essential to better control this devastating canine disease.
