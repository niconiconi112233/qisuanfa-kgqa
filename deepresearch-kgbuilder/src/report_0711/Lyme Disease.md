## Disease Overview

Lyme disease is a zoonotic infection caused by the bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_, which is transmitted to humans and animals through tick bites. It is one of the most common vector-borne diseases in the United States and other parts of the world. [1] Dogs can become infected with _B. burgdorferi_ when bitten by infected ticks, particularly the blacklegged tick (_Ixodes scapularis_) and the western blacklegged tick (_Ixodes pacificus_). [2] 

While most dogs infected with _B. burgdorferi_ remain asymptomatic, a small percentage (5-10%) can develop clinical signs of Lyme disease, which may include fever, lameness, swollen joints, and in some cases, kidney disease. [3] The disease can be difficult to diagnose, as the clinical signs can be similar to other tick-borne illnesses. [4] Treatment typically involves a course of antibiotics, and prevention focuses on tick control measures and vaccination in high-risk areas. [5]

## Common Pathogens

In areas where Lyme disease is endemic or emerging, dogs and cats can become infected with the bacteria _Borrelia burgdorferi_ when feeding ticks inoculate the organisms. While dogs can develop clinical signs like intermittent lameness, fever, and swollen joints, most infected animals do not show overt illness. 

The tick species that transmit _B. burgdorferi_ to pets include the blacklegged tick (_Ixodes scapularis_) in the northeastern and upper Midwestern United States, and the western blacklegged tick (_Ixodes pacificus_) on the Pacific coast. Dogs and cats do not serve as important reservoirs for transmitting the infection to humans. [1]

However, other tick-borne pathogens like _Anaplasma_, _Ehrlichia_, and _Babesia_ species can also infect dogs and cats, sometimes causing coinfections that lead to more severe clinical signs. More research is still needed to fully understand the disease manifestations associated with non-_Borrelia burgdorferi_ tick-borne infections in companion animals. [1]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Dogs with Lyme disease typically present with intermittent, shifting lameness, fever, anorexia, lethargy, and lymphadenopathy with or without swollen, painful joints [1]. A renal syndrome characterized by uremia, hyperphosphatemia, and severe protein-losing nephropathy has also been attributed to Lyme disease in dogs, though a causal relationship has not been conclusively established [1]. 

In horses, well-documented clinical signs of Lyme borreliosis include neuroborreliosis, uveitis, and cutaneous lymphoma [1]. Horses with neuroborreliosis may exhibit spinal muscle atrophy, dysphagia, laryngeal dysfunction, facial paresis, spinal cord ataxia and paresis, behavioral changes, and hyperesthesia [1].

Most cats do not show any symptoms of Lyme disease, though they can become infected and mount an antibody response [1]. The few cats that do develop signs may experience lameness, fatigue, loss of appetite, and fever [2].

## Diagnostic Methods

Lyme disease can present with a range of clinical signs in dogs, including polyarthritis and glomerulonephritis. Diagnosis involves a combination of diagnostic testing and clinical judgment. 

Screening tests, such as the SNAP 4DX PLUS or Accuplex 4 assays, can detect antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi as early as 3-5 weeks after a dog has been bitten by an infected tick [1]. These tests can indicate prior exposure to the bacteria, but a positive result does not necessarily mean the dog is clinically ill. 

For dogs that test positive on the initial screening, veterinarians may recommend repeating the test with a different assay. They may also evaluate the dog's blood and urine to assess kidney function and check for protein in the urine, which could signal underlying kidney disease related to Lyme infection [1].

The decision to treat for Lyme disease is somewhat controversial, as many infected dogs remain asymptomatic. Treatment with antibiotics like doxycycline is typically recommended for dogs showing signs of illness compatible with Lyme disease, or those with abnormal protein levels in the urine [1]. A positive response to antibiotic treatment within 1-3 days can provide additional diagnostic support.

## Treatment Options

The main treatment for Lyme disease in cats is the antibiotic doxycycline. This is considered the "gold standard" medication, though not all cats tolerate doxycycline well. Antibiotics are typically prescribed for 30 days, but some cats may require additional courses in the future to prevent relapses.

In addition to antibiotics, cats may also be given non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or other pain medications to help manage acute pain and discomfort during the infection. Supportive care such as IV fluids, anti-nausea medications, and nutritional support may be needed for cats with severe cases affecting the internal organs. These cats may require long-term hospitalization.

Most cats start feeling better within a day or two after starting antibiotic treatment, but it's crucial to complete the full course of antibiotics. However, Lyme bacteria can sometimes hide in the body and cause relapses, requiring additional antibiotic treatment down the line.

While the prognosis is generally good for cats with Lyme disease that is caught and treated early, complications like arthritis and kidney damage can occur in some cases. Prevention through tick control and, in high-risk areas, Lyme vaccination is the best approach.

## Preventive Measures

The key to preventing Lyme disease in dogs is a multi-pronged approach. First, it is important to limit a dog's exposure to ticks through year-round tick control measures. This includes using effective tick prevention products such as collars, topicals, or chewables, and regularly checking for and removing any attached ticks [1]. Prompt removal of ticks is crucial, as the Lyme bacteria require at least 24-48 hours of tick attachment to transmit the infection [2].

In areas where Lyme disease is endemic or emerging, vaccination of dogs against _Borrelia burgdorferi_ is also recommended [1,3]. The Lyme vaccine helps prevent infection and reduces the severity of disease in dogs that become infected. Vaccination should be combined with tick prevention for optimal protection.

Additionally, avoiding areas known to have high tick populations, such as tall grassy or wooded habitats, can further reduce a dog's risk of exposure [1]. Maintaining a short lawn and removing leaf litter around the home can also help create a less tick-friendly environment.

By implementing a comprehensive prevention strategy involving tick control, vaccination, and environmental management, the risk of Lyme disease in dogs can be greatly reduced.

## Differential Diagnosis

When diagnosing Lyme disease, it is important to rule out other diseases with similar symptoms. Some key considerations are:

[1] Infection with other tick-borne pathogens such as *Ehrlichia*, *Anaplasma*, *Babesia*, or *Rickettsia* can cause clinical signs resembling Lyme disease.[1,2] These co-infections should be tested for and excluded.

[2] Orthopedic disorders like trauma or immune-mediated diseases can also present with lameness and joint swelling, similar to Lyme borreliosis.[1] These must be ruled out through diagnostic testing.

[3] Proteinuria and glomerular disease are sometimes associated with Lyme disease, but can also have other underlying causes. A thorough diagnostic investigation is warranted to determine the specific cause.[1,3] 

[4] While most seropositive dogs are asymptomatic, a positive Lyme antibody test alone does not confirm the disease is the cause of clinical signs. The history, physical exam, and response to treatment must also be considered.[1,2]

In summary, a diagnosis of Lyme disease requires excluding other potential causes of the observed clinical signs, in addition to evidence of *Borrelia burgdorferi* exposure and a compatible clinical presentation. A multifaceted approach incorporating serology, clinical signs, and treatment response is recommended to reach an accurate diagnosis.
