## Disease Overview

Feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) is a common condition in cats, characterized by a variety of lower urinary tract signs such as dysuria, hematuria, periuria, pollakiuria, and stranguria.[1,2] The causes of FLUTD can be diverse, including idiopathic cystitis, urolithiasis, urinary tract infections, and urethral obstruction.[3] 

Epidemiological studies indicate that the prevalence of FLUTD ranges from 2 to 13 cases per 100 cats.[2] Specific breed, age, sex, and neutering status have been associated with an increased risk for certain types of FLUTD.[2] For example, Russian Blue, Himalayan, and Persian cats have an increased risk for urocystolithiasis, while Abyssinian cats are at higher risk for bacterial urinary tract infections.[2] Cats between 2 and 7 years of age have an increased risk for urethral plugs, neurogenic disorders, and congenital defects, while older cats over 10 years are more prone to urinary tract infections and neoplasia.[2] Castrated males and spayed females also have an increased risk for various FLUTD conditions compared to sexually intact cats.[2]

In a significant proportion of cases (55-65%), the underlying cause of FLUTD cannot be identified, and the condition is classified as feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC).[3-5] FIC is a complex disorder that may involve factors outside the lower urinary tract, such as stress and behavior.[6,7] Environmental and dietary management are important aspects of FIC treatment.

## Common Pathogens

Feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) can have several viral, bacterial, and other pathogenic causes. Some of the most common pathogens associated with FLUTD include:

[1] Bacterial infections: Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are relatively uncommon in cats, accounting for only 1.5-20% of FLUTD cases. However, when present, the most common bacterial culprits are Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species, and Enterococcus species. [2,3] E. coli is often the primary infectious agent, although it can also be present in mixed infections alongside other bacteria. Staphylococcus species, including S. pseudintermedius, have shown an increasing prevalence in recent years and can pose a zoonotic risk. [3] Enterococcus species, while sometimes considered incidental findings, can also contribute to infections when present. 

[3,4] Viral and fungal infections are less common causes of FLUTD, but can occur. Feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC), a condition of unknown cause, is actually the leading driver of FLUTD, accounting for 55-60% of cases. [1,4] Other potential causes include urolithiasis (urinary stones), urethral obstructions, and in rare cases, cancer of the urinary tract. [1,4]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Cats with feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) typically present with a variety of lower urinary tract signs, including:

- Dysuria (difficulty urinating)
- Stranguria (painful or slow urination) 
- Hematuria (blood in the urine)
- Pollakiuria (increased frequency of urination)
- Periuria (inappropriate urination outside the litter box)

These clinical signs are commonly associated with feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC), which is the most common cause of FLUTD. Cats with FIC often appear healthy otherwise, but may exhibit some additional physical examination findings, such as:

- Increased vocalization during urination
- Straining to urinate with little or no urine produced
- Licking the genital area
- Lethargy or anorexia during acute episodes

In severe cases, complete urethral obstruction can occur, leading to increased distress, anuria, and life-threatening electrolyte and metabolic imbalances. This is considered a medical emergency requiring immediate veterinary attention.

The diagnosis of FIC is one of exclusion, as there is no definitive test. Veterinarians will typically rule out other potential causes of FLUTD, such as urinary tract infections, urolithiasis, and anatomical abnormalities, through diagnostic tests like urinalysis, urine culture, and imaging. Treatment for FIC aims to manage pain, reduce stress, and modify the environment to prevent recurrence of clinical signs.

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosing the underlying cause of feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) typically involves a combination of clinical presentation, laboratory testing, and imaging.

A complete urinalysis is the minimum recommended diagnostic test. This includes evaluating the urine dipstick, measuring the specific gravity, and examining the urine sediment [1]. Urinalysis can identify signs of inflammation, infection, or the presence of crystals or stones.

Abdominal radiography is also recommended to rule out the presence of uroliths (stones) [1,3]. Radiopaque stones like struvite and calcium oxalate can often be visualized on x-rays. Ultrasonography may be used alongside radiography to further assess the bladder and kidneys [1,9].

If the cause is still unclear after urinalysis and imaging, additional testing may be warranted. A quantitative urine culture can diagnose bacterial urinary tract infections, which are an uncommon but important cause of FLUTD [1,3]. Contrast cystography or urethrocystography may be used to evaluate the lower urinary tract anatomy [8,9]. 

In cats over 10 years old or those with frequently recurring/persistent signs, differentials like urinary tract neoplasia should also be considered. Advanced imaging like CT or MRI, and possibly cystoscopy or bladder biopsies, may be required to diagnose these rarer conditions [1].

Overall, a thorough diagnostic approach is essential to determine the specific underlying cause of FLUTD in order to guide appropriate treatment. The combination of clinical signs, urinalysis, imaging, and other targeted tests allows veterinarians to differentiate between the common causes like feline idiopathic cystitis, urolithiasis, and urinary tract infections.

## Treatment Options

Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease (FLUTD) can have a variety of causes, including urinary tract infections, bladder stones, feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC), and others. The specific treatment approach depends on the underlying cause.

[1] For urinary tract infections, antibiotics are typically prescribed based on the results of a urine culture and sensitivity test. [2] Bladder stones may require dietary changes to dissolve them or surgical removal. [3] FIC, which is a common cause of FLUTD, is more challenging to treat as the exact cause is unknown. 

For FIC, the primary treatment goals are to [1] increase water intake to dilute the urine, [2] manage pain and inflammation, and [3] reduce stress. Specific treatments can include:

- Dietary changes to high-moisture canned food and increased water intake
- Pain medications like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
- Supplements to repair the bladder's protective glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layer
- Environmental modifications to reduce stress, such as providing perches, hiding spots, and reduced inter-cat conflict
- Behavioral medication or pheromone therapy to help manage anxiety

The veterinarian will create an individualized treatment plan based on the cat's specific condition and needs. Ongoing monitoring and adjustments to the treatment plan are often required, as FIC can be a chronic, recurring condition.

## Preventive Measures

To help prevent future occurrences of feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD), there are several key strategies pet owners can implement:

[1] Feed small, frequent meals of a specialized diet prescribed by the veterinarian. Many commercial cat foods are acceptable, but some urinary conditions respond better to diets formulated to reduce the risk of urinary stone formation. [2] Ensure your cat has constant access to clean, fresh water to encourage increased water intake and frequent urination. [3] Provide an adequate number of litter boxes (usually one more than the number of cats in the household) with the type of litter your cat prefers. [4] Keep litter boxes clean by scooping twice daily and changing the litter weekly (or more often as needed). [5] Minimize major changes in your cat's daily routine and reduce sources of stress in their environment. [6] Maintain your cat's ideal body weight through appropriate diet and exercise to lower their risk.

By implementing these preventive measures, you can help reduce the chances of your cat experiencing recurrent episodes of FLUTD. However, if your cat does develop urinary symptoms again, be sure to promptly consult your veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment.

## Differential Diagnosis

The key differential diagnoses that must be considered when evaluating a cat with FLUTD symptoms include:

[1] Feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC): This is the most common cause of FLUTD, especially in younger cats under 10 years old. FIC is a complex condition involving bladder inflammation without an identifiable underlying cause. [1]

[2] Urolithiasis (bladder stones): Stones in the bladder or urethra can cause irritation and obstruction. Struvite and calcium oxalate stones are the most common types. Urolithiasis accounts for 15-22% of FLUTD cases in younger cats. [2]

[3] Urethral plugs: These soft, compressible plugs containing minerals, cells, and mucus can block the urethra, especially in male cats. Urethral plugs cause 10-21% of FLUTD cases in younger cats. [2] 

[4] Urinary tract infection (UTI): Bacterial infections are an uncommon cause of FLUTD, present in only 5-15% of cases. UTIs are more likely in older cats with comorbidities like kidney disease or diabetes. [1]

[5] Neoplasia: Bladder or urethral cancers are rare causes of FLUTD, but should be ruled out, especially in cats over 10 years old. [2,3]

The differential diagnosis is important because the underlying cause determines the appropriate treatment approach. A thorough diagnostic workup including urinalysis, urine culture, imaging, and potentially advanced imaging or cystoscopy may be necessary to identify the specific cause in each case. [3]

# Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease

Feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) is a common condition in cats, characterized by a variety of lower urinary tract signs. The causes can be diverse, including idiopathic cystitis, urolithiasis, urinary tract infections, and urethral obstruction. Epidemiological studies indicate the prevalence ranges from 2 to 13 cases per 100 cats, with specific breed, age, sex, and neutering status as risk factors.

## Conclusion

The diagnostic approach for FLUTD involves a combination of clinical presentation, laboratory testing, and imaging. Key methods include urinalysis, abdominal radiography, and ultrasound. Treatment depends on the underlying cause, with antibiotics for infections, dietary changes or surgery for stones, and environmental/behavioral management for idiopathic cystitis. Preventive measures focus on encouraging water intake, providing appropriate litter boxes, and minimizing stress.

The most common differential diagnoses are:

| Condition | Prevalence |
| --- | --- |
| Feline idiopathic cystitis | 55-65% of cases |
| Urolithiasis | 15-22% of cases in younger cats |
| Urethral plugs | 10-21% of cases in younger cats |
| Urinary tract infection | 5-15% of cases |

By implementing a comprehensive diagnostic approach and tailoring treatment to the specific cause, veterinarians can effectively manage FLUTD and improve outcomes for affected cats.
