## Disease Overview

Gastric perforation is a serious and life-threatening condition in veterinary medicine that can lead to septic peritonitis and death if left untreated. It occurs when the stomach wall is ruptured, allowing the contents of the stomach to leak into the abdominal cavity [1]. Gastric perforation can have several underlying causes, including gastric ulcers, neoplasms, abdominal trauma, and iatrogenic injuries [9,11]. 

Epidemiologically, gastric perforation occurs in approximately 35-45% of dogs with gastroduodenal ulcerative disease and primary neoplasms [9-11]. While the exact frequency in dogs is not well documented, spontaneous perforation due to gastric cancer is reported to occur in 0.56-3.9% of human cases [12]. In cats, little is known about the presentation and predisposing factors for spontaneous gastric perforation [4].

## Common Pathogens

The most common causes of gastric perforation in companion animals are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and neoplasia. 

NSAIDs can directly damage the gastric mucosa and also inhibit the production of protective prostaglandins. This can lead to the development of ulcers that may perforate.[1] Certain types of cancer, such as lymphoma, adenocarcinoma, and gastrinomas, can also cause gastric ulceration and perforation.[2]

Hepatic disease has also been associated with gastroduodenal ulceration, although the exact mechanism is unknown. Possible factors include increased gastric acid secretion and altered mucosal blood flow.[2] Other less common causes include trauma, spinal disease, renal disease, and inflammatory conditions like pancreatitis.[2]

In cats, lymphoma and eosinophilic or lymphoplasmacytic inflammation are the most common causes of gastric ulceration and perforation.[2] Viral and bacterial pathogens do not appear to be a major factor in the development of gastric perforations in companion animals.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

The clinical presentation of gastric perforation in dogs and cats can vary, but often includes nonspecific signs such as vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, and weight loss.[1,2] Some animals may also exhibit signs of hematemesis or melena, although these are not always present.[1,2] 

In more severe cases of gastric perforation, animals may develop clinical signs of pain, weakness, pallor, and shock.[2] Additionally, clinical signs consistent with sepsis can be present if the perforation leads to peritonitis.[2] 

Some dogs and cats with gastric ulceration may not show any overt clinical signs at all.[1,2] Overall, the clinical presentation can be quite variable and make diagnosis challenging without additional testing.

## Diagnostic Methods

The clinical and laboratory testing methods used to diagnose gastric perforation include the following:

Abdominal radiography and ultrasonography can be used to detect signs of perforation, such as free intraperitoneal gas or fluid [1]. Positional radiography, where the patient is placed in left lateral recumbency, can help visualize gas that has accumulated under the diaphragm or along the abdominal wall [1]. 

Endoscopy is considered the gold standard for diagnosing gastrointestinal ulceration and perforation [2]. This allows direct visualization of mucosal lesions and ulcers, and enables biopsy collection for further analysis [3].

Laboratory tests, such as a complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile, and urinalysis, can help identify dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and signs of infection that may accompany gastrointestinal perforation [3]. Additional testing like liver function tests or an ACTH stimulation test may also be warranted depending on the clinical picture [3].

## Treatment Options

The primary treatment for gastric perforation is surgical intervention. Proton pump inhibitor therapy is the treatment of choice to decrease gastric acid production and promote ulcer healing.[1] Combining proton pump inhibitors with H2-receptor antagonists like famotidine offers no additional benefit and may decrease the efficacy of the proton pump inhibitor.[2] 

Supportive care, including fluid and electrolyte management, is also crucial. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered prophylactically before any surgical procedure.[1] For perforated ulcers or cases with signs of sepsis, aggressive antibiotic therapy and peritoneal drainage are required.[1]

In some cases where the underlying cause can be addressed, such as discontinuing NSAID therapy, medical management with proton pump inhibitors may be sufficient.[1] However, surgical intervention is often necessary to remove or repair the perforation, especially in cases of severe ulceration or peritonitis.[1,2]

## Preventive Measures

To prevent gastric perforation, veterinarians recommend several key strategies:

[1] Perform prophylactic gastropexy in high-risk breeds, such as Great Danes, German Shepherds, and Standard Poodles. Gastropexy surgically attaches the stomach to the body wall, reducing the risk of gastric torsion and volvulus.[1,2]

[2] Feed multiple small meals per day rather than one large meal, avoid elevated food bowls, and limit exercise before and after meals. This can help prevent rapid gulping of food and gas buildup in the stomach.[3]

[3] Reduce stress at mealtimes and avoid breeding dogs with a first-degree relative who has had gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV). Stress and genetic factors can increase the risk of GDV.[3]

[4] Monitor for signs of GDV, such as non-productive retching, excessive drooling, and a distended abdomen, and seek immediate veterinary care if these occur. Early recognition and treatment are critical for survival.[3]

## Differential Diagnosis

Acute abdominal pain and gastrointestinal distress can present with a wide range of potential underlying causes. Some key differential diagnoses to consider include:

[1] Gastrointestinal disorders: Foreign body ingestion, gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease.

[2] Urogenital disorders: Urinary tract obstruction, cystitis, prostatitis, pyometra. 

[3] Hepatobiliary disorders: Cholangiohepatitis, biliary tract disease, liver abscess.

[4] Vascular disorders: Mesenteric thrombosis or torsion, splenic torsion.

[5] Infectious conditions: Septic peritonitis, pyometra, prostatitis.

[6] Metabolic/endocrine disorders: Hypoadrenocorticism, diabetic ketoacidosis.

[7] Neoplastic conditions: Gastrointestinal, reproductive tract, or abdominal organ tumors.

[8] Traumatic conditions: Abdominal trauma, herniation, abdominal wall injury.

The specific presentation and history of the patient will help narrow down the differential diagnosis. Diagnostic tests such as bloodwork, imaging, and abdominocentesis are often needed to confirm the underlying cause of the acute abdominal pain and guide appropriate treatment.

# Gastric Perforation in Pets

Gastric perforation is a serious and life-threatening condition in companion animals that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. This report synthesizes the latest research on the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, and treatment approaches for gastric perforation in dogs and cats. Key findings include the central role of NSAIDs and neoplasia as underlying causes, the variability in clinical signs, and the importance of surgical intervention coupled with supportive care. Preventive strategies such as prophylactic gastropexy are also discussed.

## Conclusion

Gastric perforation is a complex condition with diverse etiologies and clinical manifestations. Early recognition of signs, prompt diagnostic testing, and a multimodal treatment approach are critical for achieving positive outcomes. Preventive measures like dietary management and gastropexy in high-risk breeds can help reduce the incidence of this life-threatening condition. Ongoing research is needed to further elucidate the pathophysiology and optimize treatment strategies for gastric perforation in companion animals.
