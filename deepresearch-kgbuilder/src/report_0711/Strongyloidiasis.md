## Disease Overview

Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode Strongyloides species, which can infect both humans and companion animals. The species with the most clinical and epidemiological relevance are Strongyloides stercoralis in humans and dogs, and Strongyloides felis in cats. [1] This infection can lead to a life-threatening condition known as hyperinfection, particularly in immunosuppressed individuals. [1] 

The role of companion animals in the transmission cycle of human strongyloidiasis remains a topic of ongoing research. While genetic evidence suggests that some cat-derived populations of S. stercoralis may be potentially zoonotic, the extent of this transmission is still enigmatic. [2] More research is needed to clarify the epidemiological relationship between human and animal strongyloidiasis. [5]

## Common Pathogens

Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode worm Strongyloides stercoralis. This parasite can infect both dogs and cats, leading to significant health concerns. [1] Globally, the estimated prevalence of S. stercoralis infection in dogs is around 6%, with higher rates seen in stray and shelter dogs compared to owned pets. [1,4] 

Similarly, feline strongyloidiasis is a prevalent condition, with a global prevalence of approximately 13.3%. [2,3] The infection is found across all regions of the world, affecting both wild, stray, and pet cats. [2,3] However, it is important to note that some studies do not discriminate between different Strongyloides species affecting cats, making it difficult to determine the exact prevalence of S. stercoralis in this host. [2]

The variability in prevalence across different studies and geographical areas highlights the need for increased awareness and targeted control measures to address this parasitic infection in both canine and feline populations. [1,4,5]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Strongyloidiasis in pets can manifest with a range of clinical symptoms and signs. The initial presentation may be a localized pruritic, erythematous rash at the site of larval penetration through the skin [1]. Emaciation and decreased growth rate are often early signs, despite a typically good appetite and active demeanor [2]. A thorough knowledge of the diverse clinical presentations is crucial for proper diagnosis, as strongyloidiasis can cause skin lesions, coughing, and/or intestinal symptoms, especially in young or immunocompromised animals [4]. Stray cats tend to have significantly higher Strongyloides prevalence compared to pet or shelter cats [5]. Diagnosis typically relies on identifying the parasite's larvae through laboratory testing [4].

## Diagnostic Methods

The diagnosis of strongyloidiasis can be challenging, as there is no single reference standard test with high sensitivity and specificity [1,2]. Strongyloides infection in both humans and companion animals presents a significant diagnostic challenge.

Parasitological methods, such as the Baermann test, remain the most widely used approach for diagnosing Strongyloides infection in veterinary practice [4,5]. This test involves examining fresh fecal samples for the presence of Strongyloides larvae [5]. Serological tests, which detect antibodies to the parasite, can also be used, but may have lower specificity [3].

Overall, a combination of clinical signs, parasitological testing, and potentially serological assays may be necessary to accurately diagnose strongyloidiasis in companion animals [1,2,4,5]. Given the complexities involved, veterinary professionals should consult appropriate guidelines and resources to establish the most effective diagnostic approach for their patients.

## Treatment Options

Strongyloidiasis in companion animals, such as dogs and cats, can be managed through a combination of medication and supportive care. The preferred anthelmintic medications, which effectively destroy and remove the internal parasites, include ivermectin and fenbendazole.[1][3] These medications should be administered in conjunction with supportive care, such as maintaining hydration and electrolyte balance, and managing any secondary infections.[3][5]

In severe cases of hyperinfection, subcutaneous administration of ivermectin has been reported to show a good response.[2] Additionally, it is essential to consider the potential zoonotic nature of Strongyloides infections, where dogs may play a role in human strongyloidiasis and vice versa.[4] Therefore, co-treatment of companion animals may be necessary for controlling the infection in both human and animal populations.[1]

## Preventive Measures

Strongyloidiasis is an intestinal infection caused by the parasitic roundworm Strongyloides stercoralis, which can affect both dogs and cats [1]. To prevent this disease, it is important to implement a combination of vaccination and environmental management strategies.

Vaccination is an effective way to protect pets against Strongyloides infections. While there is no vaccine specifically for Strongyloidiasis, maintaining your pet's overall health through routine vaccinations can help strengthen their immune system and reduce the risk of infection [2,3].

In addition to vaccination, proper environmental management is crucial. This includes regularly cleaning and disinfecting your pet's living spaces, such as their bedding, food and water bowls, and outdoor areas where they spend time [4]. Proper disposal of pet waste can also help limit the spread of the parasite [5].

It is also important to monitor your pet's health and promptly seek veterinary care if you suspect they may have contracted Strongyloidiasis. Early detection and treatment can significantly improve the prognosis and prevent the spread of the infection to other pets or family members.

## Differential Diagnosis

Strongyloidiasis can be challenging to diagnose due to its similarity to other gastrointestinal diseases. Veterinarians should include strongyloidiasis in their differential diagnosis, particularly for young dogs and cats with gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and malabsorption.[1] 

Other conditions that can present with similar symptoms include acute appendicitis, intestinal obstruction, inflammatory bowel syndrome, proctitis, Löffler syndrome, and peritonitis.[3] Diagnosis of strongyloidiasis relies on the microscopic identification of Strongyloides stercoralis larvae, typically the rhabditiform first-stage larvae, in fresh fecal samples using techniques like the Baermann larval sedimentation.[2,4,5] Serological tests may also be helpful, but there are no commercially available tests for pets at this time.[5]

# Pet Disease: Strongyloidiasis

Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode Strongyloides species, which can infect both humans and companion animals. This report synthesizes current research on the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of strongyloidiasis in dogs and cats. Key findings include the global prevalence of S. stercoralis in dogs (around 6%) and cats (approximately 13.3%), as well as the diverse clinical symptoms and challenges in accurate diagnosis. Effective treatment options involve anthelmintic medications like ivermectin and fenbendazole, coupled with supportive care. Preventive measures focus on vaccination, environmental management, and prompt veterinary intervention.

## Conclusion

Strongyloidiasis poses a significant health concern for companion animals, with varied prevalence across different regions and host species. Accurate diagnosis remains a challenge, often requiring a combination of parasitological and serological testing. Prompt treatment with appropriate anthelmintic drugs, along with supportive care, is crucial to manage the infection. Preventive strategies, including vaccination, proper hygiene, and environmental control, are essential to reduce the impact of this parasitic disease on pet populations. Further research is needed to clarify the epidemiological relationship between human and animal strongyloidiasis, as well as to develop more sensitive and specific diagnostic tools for veterinary use.
