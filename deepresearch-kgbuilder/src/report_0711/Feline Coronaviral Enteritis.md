## Disease Overview

Feline coronaviral enteritis, also known as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), is a viral disease caused by certain strains of the feline coronavirus (FCoV) [1]. The virus typically infects the gastrointestinal tract, but in some cases, it can mutate and become a more virulent form called the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) [2]. 

FIP is considered an uncommon but serious disease, affecting around 5-10% of cats infected with the FCoV [4]. Younger cats, especially those under 1.5 years old, are at a higher risk of developing FIP, with around 70% of cases being diagnosed in this age group [2]. The disease can manifest in either a "wet" form, with fluid accumulation in the abdomen or chest, or a "dry" form, affecting the central nervous system [2].

While most FCoV infections are benign, the virus can undergo mutations that allow it to spread throughout the cat's body and cause the deadly FIP condition [1,2]. The exact reasons why some cats develop this more severe form of the disease are not fully understood, but factors like age, immune status, and environmental stressors likely play a role [2,5].

## Common Pathogens

Feline coronaviral enteritis is caused by two main pathogens:

1. Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV): This is the avirulent, low-pathogenic biotype that causes asymptomatic or mild, transient intestinal infections in cats. FECV primarily infects and replicates in the intestinal epithelial cells [1].

2. Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV): This is the virulent, highly pathogenic biotype that can develop from FECV through spontaneous mutations. FIPV is able to infect and replicate in monocytes/macrophages, leading to a severe, systemic disease called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [1,2].

Additionally, some other relevant pathogens include:

- Clostridium perfringens: This bacterial pathogen can also be detected in cats with chronic diarrhea, often in combination with feline coronavirus [6].

- Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptococcus neoformans: These are infectious agents that can cause neurological or systemic disease in cats and may be considered in the differential diagnosis for FIP [12].

In summary, the primary causative agents of feline coronaviral enteritis are the two biotypes of feline coronavirus - the less virulent FECV and the highly pathogenic FIPV. Other pathogens like Clostridium, Toxoplasma, and Cryptococcus may also be involved in some cases.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Feline coronaviral enteritis, also known as feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) infection, typically causes mild or subclinical intestinal illness in kittens. [1] The most common clinical signs are diarrhea and vomiting, which are usually transient and self-limiting. [1,2] 

Some cats may also experience upper respiratory symptoms like sneezing, watery eyes, and nasal discharge. [2] In the majority of cases, infected cats show no obvious symptoms and the infection remains subclinical. [2] 

Rarely, the infection can lead to more severe symptoms. Acute and severe vomiting and diarrhea have been reported, as well as chronic gastrointestinal signs that are unresponsive to treatment. [1] However, mortality due to the enteric coronavirus infection alone is uncommon. [1]

## Diagnostic Methods

Feline coronaviral enteritis typically causes a subclinical or mild, transient intestinal infection in kittens. Fecal shedding of feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) begins within 1 week of initial infection and persists at high levels for 2â€“10 months, followed by an extended period (up to 24 months) of lower level, potentially intermittent, viral shedding.[1] 

Identification of FECV carrier cats requires nine monthly, consecutive positive fecal RT-PCR tests, whereas identification of a cat that has eliminated FECV infection requires five consecutive negative fecal RT-PCR tests.[1]

In clinical FIP suspect cats, the RT-PCR test can also identify FECV in ascites fluid, whole blood, plasma, serum or fresh tissues (kidney, liver, or spleen).[3] A positive FECV RT-PCR result in fluids or tissues from a cat with clinical signs consistent with FIP may indicate active FIP.[3] However, a positive FECV RT-PCR result in tissues from a clinically normal cat is only indicative of infection with FECV, not FIP.[3]

The clinical utility of serologic evaluation for antibodies to FECV is questionable. Positive coronavirus antibody titers are detected in up to 40% of pet cats and in up to 90% of cats in catteries or multicat households.[1] Positive FECV antibody titers are indicative only of exposure to the virus and are not suggestive of the etiology of the current disease, do not correlate with the risk of developing FIP, and are not diagnostic for FIP.[1]

Histologic lesions suggestive of FECV enteritis include intestinal villous fusion, atrophy, or sloughing. However, these lesions are nonspecific, so definitive diagnosis requires immunohistochemical or immunofluorescent detection of viral antigen in intestinal epithelial cells.[1]

## Treatment Options

Supportive Care
- Fluid therapy, oral electrolyte solutions, and anti-emetics may be needed for symptomatic treatment.
- Steroids like prednisolone or dexamethasone can help stabilize patients, but should be discontinued once improvement is seen.
- Pleural or abdominal effusions may require drainage, but repeated drainage can be detrimental. 
- Supportive care for neurological signs, ocular issues, anemia, and poor appetite is important.

Antiviral Drugs
- The antiviral drug GS-441524 has shown promise as an effective treatment for FIP, with reported cure rates over 85%.
- GS-441524 is the active metabolite of the drug remdesivir, which has emergency use authorization for COVID-19 treatment.
- GS-441524 requires a veterinary prescription and is currently only legally available in certain countries like Australia and the UK. An oral compounded formulation has recently become available in the US.
- Treatment typically lasts 12 weeks or more. Proper monitoring by a veterinarian is required.

In summary, supportive care to address clinical signs combined with the use of effective antiviral drugs like GS-441524 have greatly improved the prognosis for cats with FIP. Consultation with a veterinarian is essential to determine the most appropriate treatment approach.

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination and environmental management are key strategies for preventing feline coronaviral enteritis. While a USDA-approved vaccine for the related condition of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) was developed decades ago, it is not recommended due to the potential for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) which can worsen the disease.[1] 

However, recent research has led to the development of a promising new mRNA-based vaccine that targets internal viral proteins rather than surface proteins, avoiding the ADE issue.[1] This vaccine is designed to be given to kittens before or soon after they have been infected with the milder gastrointestinal form of the coronavirus, allowing them to clear the virus before it can mutate and cause the deadly FIP.[1]

In addition to vaccination, environmental management is crucial. Feline enteric coronavirus can survive for up to 7 weeks in dry environments, so regular disinfection of litter boxes, cages, and other surfaces is important.[2] Proper housing of cats in small, closed groups based on their antibody and virus shedding status can also help limit transmission.[2]

## Differential Diagnosis

Feline coronaviral enteritis can be difficult to distinguish from other gastrointestinal diseases in cats, as the clinical signs can be similar. Some key differential diagnoses to consider include:

[1] Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP): FIP is caused by a mutated form of the feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) that can infect macrophages. This more virulent form, known as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), can lead to a severe, often fatal systemic disease. While FECV typically causes only mild, self-limiting gastroenteritis, FIPV can manifest with more severe abdominal effusions and systemic signs. [2]

[3] Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): IBD in cats can present with chronic vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss, similar to feline coronaviral enteritis. Differentiating between the two may require additional diagnostic tests such as intestinal biopsies.

[4] Dietary intolerance or allergy: Gastrointestinal signs like diarrhea can also be caused by sensitivities to certain food ingredients or additives. Dietary trials may help distinguish this from infectious causes.

[5] Other infectious agents: Viral (e.g., parvovirus), bacterial (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter), and parasitic (e.g., giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis) agents can all cause acute or chronic gastrointestinal signs that overlap with feline coronaviral enteritis.

Thorough history-taking, physical examination, and diagnostic testing (e.g., fecal PCR, serology, imaging) are necessary to differentiate feline coronaviral enteritis from these other potential causes of gastrointestinal disease in cats.
