## Disease Overview

Trombiculosis, also known as trombidiosis or trombiculiasis, is a skin condition caused by the larval stage of mites from the Trombiculidae family, commonly referred to as "chiggers." These mites are found worldwide, especially in warm, humid environments. The larvae feed on their hosts by injecting lytic enzymes into the upper layers of the skin, leading to the development of multiple, erythematous, and/or excoriated papules associated with intense itching. 

The condition is often misdiagnosed due to the unspecific nature of the cutaneous findings. The European harvest mite (Neotrombicula autumnalis) is the most common causative agent in Europe, while the American chigger mite (Eutrombicula alfreddugesi) is the most common in the United States. In Asia, the Asian chigger (Eutrombicula sarcina) is the predominant species. Trombiculosis is a self-limiting condition, but correct identification of the parasite is important for appropriate treatment.

## Common Pathogens

Trombiculosis, also known as chigger bites, is caused by the parasitic larval stage of mites in the Trombiculidae family. The most common species that cause trombiculosis in dogs include _Eutrombicula alfreddugesi_ in the southern United States, _Trombicula autumnalis_ in Europe, and the _Leptotrombidium_ genus in Asia-Pacific regions.[1] 

These mite larvae feed on the skin of various animals, including dogs, and secrete enzymes that digest epidermal cells. This provokes an inflammatory reaction with erythema, swelling, and intense pruritus.[1,2] The larvae can easily detach from the host, but the irritation and allergic response may last for weeks.

In addition to the localized skin irritation, chigger bites can potentially transmit pathogens. Chiggers are known vectors of scrub typhus, a serious bacterial infection caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_.[3,4] However, the transmission of other diseases like Hantavirus, Lyme disease, and Ehrlichiosis from chiggers to dogs has not been conclusively reported.[1,3]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Trombiculosis, or infestation with chigger mites, can cause a variety of clinical symptoms in dogs and cats. The tiny, orange-red larvae of these mites attach to the host's skin and feed, injecting digestive enzymes that cause intense itching and irritation. [1] 

Affected pets may exhibit severe pruritus (itching), leading to scratching, biting, and licking of the skin. This can result in skin lesions such as crusts, hair loss, and raw, moist areas. [2] The mites are commonly found clustered around the head, ears, feet, and belly. [3] 

In some cases, the itching may persist even after the mites have detached, due to the irritation caused by the mite's digestive enzymes. [3] Secondary bacterial or yeast infections may also develop in the damaged skin.

While trombiculosis is generally self-limiting, the intense pruritus and skin lesions can cause significant discomfort for the affected pet. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important to provide relief and prevent complications.

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosis of trombiculosis is based on history and clinical signs. The infestation is a seasonal threat to free-ranging dogs and cats. Differential diagnoses include other pruritic dermatoses. Diagnosis is confirmed by careful examination of the affected areas. Microscopic examination of samples obtained from skin scrapings may help to identify the larvae, which have an oval-shaped body densely covered with setae, six long legs, and curved pedipalps terminating in claws.

## Treatment Options

Trombiculosis, also known as "chigger infestation", is a type of mange caused by the parasitic larval stage of mites from the Trombiculidae family. The larvae attach to the host, feed for a few days, and then detach when engorged. This can cause intense itching, redness, bumps, and skin crusts in affected pets.

Treatment for trombiculosis typically involves a multi-pronged approach:

[1] Medications - Your veterinarian may prescribe medications to kill the mite larvae, such as topical treatments or injections. These are often different from medications used for other types of mites. It's important to follow your vet's instructions carefully.

[2] Supportive care - If the itching has been severe or prolonged, antibiotics or other medications may be needed to control any secondary skin infections from scratching and biting.

[3] Environmental control - Prevention of reinfestation is challenging, but avoiding areas known to harbor the mites can help. Keeping pets away from infested environments is the best approach.

[4] Nursing care - Bathing the pet, thoroughly drying the coat, and removing any attached larvae can provide relief and prevent spread of the infestation. Your vet can advise on the best bathing and grooming methods.

The outlook for recovery from trombiculosis is generally good with proper treatment, though the itching can persist even after the parasites have detached. Careful management under veterinary guidance is key to resolving the infestation and preventing recurrence.

## Preventive Measures

Trombiculosis, the mite infestation caused by the larval stage of chiggers, can be difficult to prevent. Since there are currently no products licensed specifically for the treatment of harvest mites in dogs and cats, using insecticides approved for flea control can effectively kill the mites. [1] It is important to choose a product with good residual activity and to confine the dog during harvest mite season. 

For dogs that are very sensitive to the bites of harvest mite larvae, additional treatment with anti-inflammatory medications may be required. [4] Preventing reinfestation is often challenging, but the most useful approach is to keep pets away from areas known to harbor the mites whenever possible. [2,3]

## Differential Diagnosis

Trombiculosis, or infestation by the larval stage of trombiculid mites (chiggers), can be differentiated from other diseases with similar symptoms through careful examination and diagnostic testing. 

One key differentiator is the presence of the characteristic orange-red, oval mite larvae attached to the dog's skin, usually clustered on the head, ears, feet, or belly [1]. These can be identified through close visual inspection and confirmed by microscopic examination of skin scrapings.

In contrast, other mite infestations like sarcoptic mange (caused by _Sarcoptes scabiei_) typically present with more generalized skin lesions, severe pruritus, and crusting, rather than the focal attachment sites seen in trombiculosis [2,3]. Demodicosis from _Demodex_ mites also has a distinct clinical presentation, with patchy hair loss and secondary skin infections [3]. 

Allergic skin diseases can cause pruritus and inflammation, but would not have the characteristic mite attachment sites [3]. Fungal infections like ringworm may appear similar, but can be differentiated through fungal culture or other diagnostic tests [3].

Overall, a combination of clinical signs, skin examination, and potentially diagnostic tests like skin scrapings or biopsies can help distinguish trombiculosis from other canine skin conditions with overlapping symptoms. Prompt diagnosis is important to guide appropriate treatment [1,3].

# Pet Disease: Trombiculosis

Trombiculosis, or chigger infestation, is a skin condition caused by the parasitic larval stage of mites in the Trombiculidae family. These microscopic pests attach to the host's skin, injecting digestive enzymes that trigger intense itching and inflammation. Affecting both dogs and cats, trombiculosis presents with distinctive symptoms and requires prompt veterinary care for proper diagnosis and treatment.
