## Disease Overview

Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic flatworms known as blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma [3]. It is an important health concern for both humans and companion animals, particularly in certain regions. In non-human animal hosts, the diagnosis of Schistosoma infection can be challenging and requires the use of various diagnostic techniques [1,2]. 

Heterobilharzia americana, a trematode parasite endemic to the Gulf states of the United States, has been identified as a causative agent of schistosomiasis in companion animals like dogs [5]. Treatment protocols typically involve the use of praziquantel and fenbendazole, although retreatment may be necessary in some cases [4]. Overall, schistosomiasis in non-human animal hosts remains an area of active research and clinical importance.

## Common Pathogens

Schistosomiasis in pets is caused by a digenean trematode parasite called Heterobilharzia americana, which belongs to the family Schistosomatidae.[1][2][3][4] This parasite is the etiologic agent of canine schistosomiasis in the southeastern United States.[1][2][3][4] 

Clinical signs of schistosomiasis in dogs include persistent diarrhea (sometimes with blood), vomiting, hepatopathy, hypercalcemia, and weight loss.[5] Ultrasonographic evidence of heterogeneous small intestinal wall layering and pinpoint hyperechoic foci in the bowel, lymph nodes, and liver can also be diagnostic.[1][2]

Treatment of canine schistosomiasis is not always effective, but a combination of praziquantel and fenbendazole has been used successfully.[5] To prevent infection, dogs should be prevented from accessing areas where the parasite's intermediate snail host may be present.[5]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Schistosomiasis, also known as canine or feline liver fluke, is a parasitic infection caused by the trematode worm Heterobilharzia americana. The clinical presentation of schistosomiasis in dogs and cats can vary, but typically includes gastrointestinal symptoms. [1]

Common clinical signs reported in infected dogs include diarrhea, which may be bloody or mucoid, vomiting, poor appetite, weight loss, lethargy, and dehydration. [2,3] Laboratory abnormalities such as anemia and hypoalbuminemia have also been documented. [4] In some cases, dogs may exhibit other non-specific signs like polyuria and polydipsia. [5]

The clinical manifestations of schistosomiasis can be subtle and mimic other gastrointestinal diseases, making diagnosis challenging. A high index of suspicion, along with appropriate diagnostic testing, is necessary to identify this parasitic infection in companion animals. [1,5]

## Diagnostic Methods

Schistosomiasis, caused by the trematode parasite Heterobilharzia americana, is an important disease in dogs in the southeastern United States. Diagnosing this condition can be challenging due to the nonspecific clinical signs and difficulty in detecting the parasite eggs.

The most reliable diagnostic approach involves a combination of clinical signs, laboratory testing, and imaging. Common clinical signs in infected dogs include diarrhea (which may be blood-tinged), vomiting, poor appetite, weight loss, lethargy, and abdominal pain [1,2,10]. Clinicopathologic abnormalities can include anemia, hyperglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypercalcemia, and elevated liver enzymes [2-6].

Definitive diagnosis requires demonstrating the presence of H. americana eggs. Standard fecal flotation techniques are often ineffective, as the eggs do not float well [4,16]. Fecal sedimentation and direct saline smears are more sensitive methods for detecting the eggs [4,16]. A specialized miracidia hatching technique can also aid in identifying the eggs [16].

More recently, a commercial fecal PCR test has become available, which provides a highly sensitive and specific way to diagnose H. americana infection [7,8,9]. Abdominal imaging with radiography or ultrasound may show thickening of the intestinal wall, enlargement of the liver and spleen, and other nonspecific changes [2,14].

In summary, a combination of clinical signs, clinicopathologic abnormalities, and specialized diagnostic testing (fecal sedimentation, PCR) are needed to effectively diagnose canine schistosomiasis caused by H. americana.

## Treatment Options

Treating schistosomiasis in pets typically involves a combination of medication and supportive care. The most commonly used medications are praziquantel and fenbendazole. [1] A combination of these two drugs has been used successfully to treat the infection, with praziquantel administered at a high dose of 25 mg/kg every 8 hours for 2 days. [2] Fenbendazole can also be used as a prolonged treatment, given at 40 mg/kg once daily for 10 days, with the treatment potentially needing to be repeated. [2]

In addition to the antiparasitic medications, supportive care is essential. This may include providing nutritional and fluid support, as well as pain medications, anti-nausea medications, and antibiotics to address any secondary infections. [3] Monitoring the pet's response to treatment is crucial to ensure the infection is effectively eradicated. [4] In some cases, a low-dose protocol of praziquantel and fenbendazole may be effective for asymptomatic schistosomiasis, but close monitoring is still recommended. [4]

## Preventive Measures

To prevent schistosomiasis in companion animals, the most effective strategy is to avoid exposure to contaminated freshwater sources. Dogs and other pets should not be allowed to swim, wade, or bathe in lakes, rivers, or other bodies of water where the parasitic worms that cause schistosomiasis may be present [1]. 

Environmental management is also crucial. In areas where schistosomiasis is endemic, fencing off dangerous water sources and herding animals in snail-free regions can help break the parasite's life cycle and reduce transmission [3,4]. Proper treatment and disposal of animal feces is another important preventive measure [4].

Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine available for schistosomiasis in companion animals [2]. Vigilant avoidance of contaminated waters and careful management of the surrounding environment remain the best ways to protect pets from this serious parasitic disease.

## Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating a pet for potential schistosomiasis, it is important to consider other diseases that may present with similar symptoms. Canine schistosomiasis, caused by the parasite Heterobilharzia americana, can manifest with persistent diarrhea (sometimes with blood), vomiting, and liver disease [1]. Other parasitic infections such as giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, and coccidiosis can also cause gastrointestinal signs [2]. Additionally, inflammatory bowel disease, food allergies, and certain viral or bacterial infections may produce comparable symptoms [3]. 

Laboratory tests that can support the diagnosis of schistosomiasis include eosinophilia, elevated IgE levels, elevated fecal calprotectin, and occult blood in the stool [2]. Microscopic identification of parasite eggs in the stool or urine is the primary diagnostic method [4]. The recent development of a fecal PCR test has also improved the ability to diagnose Heterobilharzia americana infection in dogs [5].

Schistosomiasis is a significant health concern for both humans and companion animals, particularly in certain regions. Caused by parasitic flatworms, this neglected tropical disease can manifest with persistent diarrhea, vomiting, and liver disease in dogs. Diagnosing schistosomiasis can be challenging, often requiring a combination of clinical signs, specialized laboratory testing, and imaging. Treatment typically involves a combination of antiparasitic medications, supportive care, and careful monitoring. Preventing exposure to contaminated freshwater sources is crucial, as no vaccine is currently available for pets.

## Conclusion

The report provides a comprehensive overview of schistosomiasis in companion animals, including its clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, treatment options, and preventive measures. Key insights include the importance of a multifaceted diagnostic approach, the potential need for repeated treatment, and the critical role of environmental management in reducing disease transmission. Moving forward, continued research and increased awareness among veterinary professionals will be essential to effectively address this parasitic infection in pets.

| Diagnostic Approach | Key Findings |
