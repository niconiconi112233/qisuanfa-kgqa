## Disease Overview

Infectious Canine Hepatitis (ICH) is a viral disease caused by canine adenovirus type 1 (CAV-1), a non-enveloped, icosahedral double-stranded DNA virus. [1] ICH is a worldwide, infectious disease of dogs that can cause a wide range of clinical signs, from a slight fever and congestion to severe depression, leukopenia, and coagulation disorders. [1] 

The virus primarily targets hepatocytes and endothelial cells, leading to hepatic necrosis and endothelial damage. This can result in clinical signs like fever, lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hemorrhagic diathesis. [1,2] ICH can also cause ocular complications like corneal edema ("blue eye") and anterior uveitis. [1]

ICH is mainly transmitted through direct contact with infected urine, feces, or saliva. Young puppies under 1 year of age are at the highest risk of contracting the disease. [2,3] Before widespread vaccination, ICH was a common disease in dogs, but it has become uncommon in areas with routine immunization. [1] However, periodic outbreaks can still occur, potentially from maintenance of the virus in wild and feral hosts. [1]

In summary, Infectious Canine Hepatitis is a serious, systemic viral disease of dogs caused by canine adenovirus type 1. It can lead to severe, potentially fatal illness, especially in young, unvaccinated puppies. The disease is now uncommon in areas with good vaccination coverage, but sporadic outbreaks can still occur.

## Common Pathogens

Infectious Canine Hepatitis is caused by Canine adenovirus type 1 (CAV-1), a non-enveloped, icosahedral double-stranded DNA virus that is antigenically related to Canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2).[1] CAV-1 can infect dogs, coyotes, foxes, wolves, bears, and skunks.[1] The virus is shed in the saliva, feces, and urine of infected animals, and can survive for months at room temperature.[1,2] While CAV-1 does not infect humans, it can cause disease in a variety of wildlife hosts.[1]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Infectious canine hepatitis (ICH) due to canine adenovirus 1 (CAV-1) can cause a wide range of clinical signs in dogs, varying from a slight fever and congestion of the mucous membranes to severe depression, marked leukopenia, and coagulation disorders [1].

The most common symptoms include:

- Nonspecific signs such as lethargy, thirst, or anorexia
- Conjunctivitis, serous oculonasal discharge, or corneal clouding ("blue eye")
- Abdominal pain and vomiting, including hematemesis
- Signs consistent with coagulopathy or vasculitis, such as petechiae of the oral mucosa [1]

In some cases, the tonsils may be enlarged, and tachycardia out of proportion to the fever may occur. There may also be subcutaneous edema of the head, neck, and trunk [1].

Clotting time is directly correlated with the severity of illness, as vascular endothelial compromise can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation and failure of the liver to rapidly replace consumed clotting factors. This can make it difficult to control hemorrhage, which may manifest as bleeding around deciduous teeth and spontaneous hematomas [1].

Neurological involvement is unusual but may represent either hepatic encephalopathy or intracranial vasculitis, hemorrhage, or thrombosis. Severely infected dogs may develop seizures from forebrain damage [1].

On recovery, dogs regain weight slowly, and in around 25% of cases, bilateral corneal opacity develops 7-10 days after acute clinical signs disappear, usually resolving spontaneously [1].

## Diagnostic Methods

### Clinical Presentation

Any young puppy with evidence of severe hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy or disseminated intravascular coagulation, or corneal clouding should be considered a suspect for Infectious Canine Hepatitis (ICH). The abrupt onset of illness and bleeding often suggest ICH, although clinical evidence is not always sufficient to differentiate it from canine distemper. [1]

### Laboratory Testing

Definitive antemortem diagnosis can be obtained through commercially available ELISA, serologic, or PCR tests. PCR assay or restriction fragment length polymorphism is required to definitively distinguish the causative canine adenovirus 1 (CAV-1) from the vaccine strain CAV-2. [1]

Postmortem diagnosis can be confirmed by the presence of characteristic intranuclear inclusion bodies in the liver, virus isolation, immunofluorescence, PCR, or fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of infected tissue. [1]

### Imaging

Diagnostic imaging techniques such as abdominal radiography and ultrasonography can be used to evaluate the liver, spleen, and kidneys for enlargement or other pathologic changes. However, these imaging modalities are not specific for ICH diagnosis. [10,12]

### Key Diagnostic Features

- Abrupt onset of illness with fever, lethargy, inappetence, and bleeding tendencies
- Severe hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy, and/or corneal clouding in young puppies
- Positive ELISA, serology, or PCR tests for CAV-1
- Characteristic intranuclear inclusion bodies in liver on histopathology

## Treatment Options

The main treatment for Infectious Canine Hepatitis is supportive care, which includes:

- Providing fluid support through IV electrolyte solutions and dextrose as needed [1,2]
- Maintaining adequate nutrition [1,2] 
- Addressing the coagulopathy (blood clotting issues) through plasma/blood transfusions and anticoagulant therapy [1,2]
- Treating any secondary bacterial infections with IV antibiotics [1,2]

Transient corneal opacity (clouding of the eye) can sometimes occur, and applying atropine eye ointment may help alleviate the associated painful spasms. Dogs with corneal clouding should be protected from bright light. Systemic corticosteroids are not recommended for treating the corneal opacity, as they can worsen the condition. [1,2]

In severe cases, additional treatments like antivirals or anti-inflammatory drugs may be considered, but the mainstay of management is supportive care. [3,4] Monitoring through regular blood work is also important during recovery. [1,2]

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is the primary prevention strategy for protecting dogs against Infectious Canine Hepatitis (ICH). The injectable modified live virus (MLV) vaccine containing canine adenovirus-2 (CAV-2) provides good cross-protection against the causative agent, canine adenovirus-1 (CAV-1) [1]. 

The original CAV-1 vaccine was discontinued due to its potential to cause corneal opacity ("blue eye") in vaccinated dogs [1]. The CAV-2 vaccine is now preferred as it does not have this adverse effect.

Vaccination against ICH is recommended as part of the core vaccination protocol, starting in puppies at 6-8 weeks of age with booster shots every 3-4 weeks until 16 weeks old [2,3]. Adult dogs should receive a 1-year booster after the initial series, then be revaccinated every 3 years [1,2]. 

In addition to vaccination, strict disinfection of veterinary premises and kennels is important, as the CAV-1 virus can survive for weeks or months in the environment [1]. Exposure to a 1-3% bleach solution can inactivate the virus [1].

## Differential Diagnosis

Infectious Canine Hepatitis (ICH) presents with a wide range of nonspecific clinical signs, including fever, lethargy, inappetence, vomiting, hemorrhagic diarrhea, abdominal pain, dehydration, conjunctivitis, petechial hemorrhages, tachypnea, cough, and corneal edema.[1,2] These symptoms can also be seen in other systemic viral diseases, such as canine parvoviral enteritis and canine distemper.[1] 

Enteric viral and bacterial infections, hepatotoxicosis (e.g., from mushroom toxicity), Rocky Mountain spotted fever, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, dietary indiscretion, leptospirosis, portosystemic shunting with hepatic encephalopathy, disseminated fungal infections (especially systemic candidiasis), systemic protozoal infections (especially sarcocystosis, toxoplasmosis or African trypanosomiasis), and hemic neoplasia (especially lymphoma) should also be considered in the differential diagnosis.[1]
