## Disease Overview

Acute gastroenteritis is a common condition in cats and dogs characterized by the sudden onset of vomiting and/or diarrhea.[1] The most common causes include bacterial toxin ingestion, bacterial endotoxin production, viral enteritis, self-limiting infections, and adverse reactions to food.[1] While the exact cause is often unknown, acute gastroenteritis is typically a transient and non-life threatening condition.[1]

Fasting and withholding food for 24-48 hours was previously the standard recommendation, but research has shown that early reintroduction of a highly digestible, low-fat diet is beneficial for maintaining gut mucosal integrity and promoting recovery.[1,2] Dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition are common complications that require supportive care with fluids, antiemetics, and nutritional management.[2,3] With appropriate treatment, most cases of acute gastroenteritis resolve within 3-7 days.[1]

## Common Pathogens

Parvoviruses, coronaviruses, and rotaviruses are established causes of viral enteritis and diarrhea in dogs and cats [1]. Canine parvovirus type 2 is a highly contagious virus that can cause acute enteritis associated with high morbidity and mortality, particularly in puppies [2]. Other viral infections, as well as parasites, protozoal, and bacterial causes, can also lead to acute gastroenteritis in dogs of any age [3,4].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Acute gastroenteritis is a common condition in dogs and cats, often characterized by the sudden onset of vomiting and diarrhea.[1] Many affected animals will also exhibit signs of lethargy, abdominal discomfort, and dehydration.[2] 

On physical examination, veterinarians may observe dry oral mucous membranes, prolonged skin tenting, and weak peripheral pulses - all indicating dehydration.[2] Abdominal palpation may reveal discomfort or signs of an underlying cause, such as an intestinal foreign body.[2] 

While no specific physical exam findings are definitive for acute gastroenteritis, the constellation of vomiting, diarrhea, and clinical signs of dehydration are highly suggestive of the condition.[1,2] Early recognition and appropriate supportive care are crucial for a favorable prognosis.

## Diagnostic Methods

A thorough physical examination by a veterinarian is the first step in diagnosing acute enteritis. This can detect signs of dehydration, abdominal pain, fever, and severe fluid loss [1]. Laboratory tests such as a complete blood count, serum biochemical profile, and urinalysis may be indicated to rule out other potential causes and identify any metabolic complications [1,2]. Additional diagnostic tests like fecal examination, abdominal imaging, and endoscopy may be needed in some cases, especially if the clinical signs are severe or do not respond to initial treatment [1,2]. 

The veterinarian will aim to identify the underlying cause, which could be infectious (e.g. bacterial, viral, parasitic), dietary, or related to an underlying systemic disease. However, in many cases the specific cause of primary acute enteritis is not determined, and the diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation and exclusion of other potential causes [1,2].

## Treatment Options

For the management of acute enteritis in dogs and cats, a multifaceted approach is often recommended. Antiemetic medications can help control vomiting and reduce fluid and electrolyte losses, while gastroprotectants may provide relief for any accompanying gastrointestinal inflammation or ulceration.[1,2] 

Ondansetron and dolasetron are serotonin (5-HT3) antagonists that are commonly used off-label to control nausea and vomiting.[1] Maropitant, a neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonist, is the only licensed antiemetic for use in dogs and cats and is considered highly effective.[1] Metoclopramide, an antidopaminergic agent, can also be used but may be less potent than other antiemetic options.[1]

Gastroprotectants like sucralfate, famotidine, and omeprazole can help address any underlying gastrointestinal erosion or ulceration.[1,2] Sucralfate creates a protective barrier, while H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors reduce gastric acid production.[1]

For diarrhea, loperamide has been used off-label in dogs, but its use is not recommended due to potential neurologic toxicity in certain breeds.[1] Probiotics may also be considered, though more research is needed on their efficacy for acute gastroenteritis.[1] Routine antibiotic therapy is generally not recommended, as studies have not shown a clear benefit.[1]

Supportive care with fluid therapy, dietary management, and nursing care are also important components of treating acute enteritis. Early reintroduction of an appropriate, highly digestible diet is advised unless there is a suspicion of a gastrointestinal foreign body.[1]

In summary, the key treatment strategies for acute enteritis include:
- Antiemetic medications (e.g. ondansetron, maropitant)
- Gastroprotectants (e.g. sucralfate, omeprazole)
- Fluid therapy
- Dietary management with a highly digestible diet
- Nursing care

## Preventive Measures

To prevent acute enteritis in dogs, several steps can be taken:

Vaccination is key to preventing viral infections that can lead to enteritis.[1] Dogs should be up-to-date on core vaccinations like parvovirus, distemper, and coronavirus. 

Maintaining good flea and tick control is also important, as parasites can contribute to intestinal inflammation.[2] Monthly preventatives and regular grooming can help reduce parasite exposure.

Feeding a high-quality, easily digestible dog food and avoiding table scraps or sudden diet changes can help prevent enteritis caused by dietary indiscretion.[2] Owners should also ensure food and trash are kept out of a dog's reach.

Finally, regular veterinary check-ups allow for early detection and treatment of any underlying conditions that may predispose a dog to recurrent bouts of enteritis.[2] Prompt treatment at the first signs of vomiting or diarrhea is crucial to preventing dehydration and other serious complications.

## Differential Diagnosis

Acute gastroenteritis is a common cause of vomiting, anorexia, and diarrhea in dogs and cats, but it should be differentiated from other problems that may present with similar clinical signs, such as pancreatitis, azotemia, hepatitis, and intestinal obstruction.[1] 

Inflammation of the alimentary tract can occur due to a variety of underlying causes, including dietary indiscretion, infectious organisms, toxins, immune dysregulation, and metabolic disorders.[1] Other viral diseases that can lead to severe gastrointestinal inflammation include coronavirus and rotavirus infection, although their clinical manifestations are typically milder than canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2) infection.[6] Feline panleukopenia, caused by a parvovirus, can also cause similar signs of severe gastroenteritis in cats.[1]

The bacterial organisms most commonly associated with acute gastroenteritis in dogs and cats include Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter upsaliensis, Salmonella spp., Helicobacter spp., and enterotoxigenic E. coli.[7-10] Parasitic causes include ascarids, hookworms, whipworms, and protozoans like Giardia and Cryptosporidium.[6] Fungal diseases such as histoplasmosis can also affect the gastrointestinal tract.[1]

Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE) is a disease of unknown cause that typically affects young to middle-aged small breed dogs, characterized by acute onset of bloody diarrhea and elevated packed cell volume.[7,16] The exact role of Clostridium perfringens in HGE remains unclear.[12]

Protein-losing enteropathy, caused by severe inflammatory bowel disease, lymphangiectasia, or neoplasia, can also present with gastrointestinal signs due to excessive protein loss.[21] Extraintestinal diseases like hypoadrenocorticism, liver or kidney disease, acute pancreatitis, and peritonitis can also manifest with acute vomiting and diarrhea.[1]

# Pet Disease: Acute Enteritis

Acute enteritis is a common and often transient condition in dogs and cats, characterized by the sudden onset of vomiting and diarrhea. While the exact cause is frequently unknown, this report explores the viral, bacterial, and dietary factors that can contribute to acute gastroenteritis, as well as the clinical signs, diagnostic methods, and evidence-based treatment strategies. Preventive measures, such as vaccination and dietary management, are also discussed to help pet owners and veterinarians minimize the risk and impact of this gastrointestinal disorder.

## Summary

Acute enteritis is typically a self-limiting condition, but prompt recognition and appropriate supportive care are crucial for a favorable prognosis. Key treatment strategies include antiemetic medications, gastroprotectants, fluid therapy, and a highly digestible diet. Preventing viral infections through vaccination and avoiding dietary indiscretion can help mitigate the risk of acute gastroenteritis. While the specific cause is often undetermined, a thorough diagnostic workup and exclusion of other potential differentials are important to guide effective management. With the right combination of medical treatment and nursing care, most cases of acute enteritis in dogs and cats resolve within 3-7 days.
