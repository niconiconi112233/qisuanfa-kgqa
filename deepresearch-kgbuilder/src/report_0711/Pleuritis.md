## Disease Overview

Pleuritis is a condition in companion animals that involves inflammation of the pleural membranes that line the lungs and chest cavity. It can have various underlying causes, including bacterial infections, viral infections, and immune-mediated disorders [1]. Prevalence data indicates high rates of pleuritis and other respiratory infections among companion animals [1]. This suggests pleuritis is a common and concerning issue for the health of pets.

The epidemiology of pleuritis in companion animals is not well-characterized, but it appears to be prevalent globally. There have been increasing reports of pleuritis and other respiratory infections in companion animals, likely driven by factors like high carriage and infection rates [1-3]. Certain bacterial pathogens like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus species have been linked to cases of pleuritis in pets [3]. Better understanding the epidemiology and risk factors for pleuritis in companion animals is important for improving disease prevention and management.

## Common Pathogens

Pleuritis, or inflammation of the pleural cavity, can be caused by a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens. According to the Merck Veterinary Manual, the most common causes of pleuritis are bacterial infections [1]. Anaerobic bacteria like Bacteroides and Fusobacterium, as well as aerobic-facultative bacteria like Nocardia and Actinomyces, are frequently isolated from dogs with pyothorax (purulent pleuritis) [1,2]. In cats, Pasteurella multocida and anaerobes are the most common causative agents [2]. 

The infection can spread to the pleural cavity through various routes, including penetrating chest wounds, extension of bacterial pneumonia, migrating foreign bodies, esophageal perforations, or hematogenous spread [2]. Viral respiratory infections can also predispose animals to secondary bacterial pleuritis by impairing the normal defense mechanisms [1].

In addition to common bacterial pathogens, the Merck manual notes that pleuritis may also be caused by viruses, fungi, and parasites, as well as non-infectious causes like trauma, allergic reactions, and fluid/air accumulation in the pleural space [1]. Thorough diagnostic testing is important to identify the underlying etiology in cases of pleuritis.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Pleural effusion in dogs can cause a variety of clinical symptoms and signs. The most common include:

- Increased respiratory rate: Affected dogs often have a rapid, shallow breathing pattern as they try to compensate for the reduced lung capacity. The respiratory rate may be over 30 breaths per minute.

- Difficulty breathing: Dogs with pleural effusion may have labored, open-mouth breathing and an increased abdominal component to their respiration as they struggle to get enough air. 

- Coughing: The buildup of fluid can put pressure on the lungs and airways, leading to a frequent, often nonproductive cough.

- Restlessness: Dogs may pace, have trouble getting comfortable, and have difficulty sleeping due to the discomfort from the fluid accumulation.

- Exercise intolerance: Affected dogs may tire easily and stop to rest during walks or other activities.

- Cyanotic mucous membranes: The blue or purple discoloration of the gums, lips, and other mucous membranes can occur when oxygen levels are low.

- Lethargy and decreased appetite are also common as the body tries to divert resources to dealing with the underlying disease.

The severity of clinical signs depends on the rate of fluid accumulation and the underlying cause. Rapid accumulation of fluid or large volumes can lead to severe respiratory distress that requires immediate veterinary attention. Slower accumulation may only cause mild, non-specific symptoms at first. Recognizing and addressing pleural effusion quickly is important to avoid respiratory failure.

Here is a draft of the Diagnostic Methods section:

## Diagnostic Methods

The clinical evaluation, laboratory testing, and imaging techniques used to diagnose pleuritis are reviewed.

Diagnosis of pleural effusion often begins with recognition that the pet has respiratory difficulty with a rapid shallow breathing pattern. Auscultation of the heart may reveal muffled heart tones. Percussion of the chest may result in dull percussive notes. Confirmation of pleural effusion ideally requires aspiration of free pleural fluid, although loculated fluid may be difficult to aspirate. [1]

Cytologic evaluation of the pleural fluid is consistent with a septic or a nonseptic exudate. Degenerate neutrophils and mixed population of bacteria are usually seen. An exudate typically exhibits a total protein greater than 3.0 g/dL, a specific gravity greater than 1.018, and a total cell count greater than 30 x 103 cells/μL. [1,2] Septic exudates characteristic of pyothorax have viscous, opaque fluid that may clot or exhibit fibrinous debris and often produce a foul odor. Cell counts range from 30 to 200 x 103 cells/μL, although accurate cell counts are difficult due to extensive cellular degeneration. [1]

Radiographic signs of pleural effusion include retraction of the lung lobes away from the thoracic wall, presence of pleural fissure lines, and partial or complete border effacement of the cardiac silhouette and diaphragm. [2,3] Unilateral pleural effusions are usually secondary to exudates, as the mediastinum in dogs and cats is fenestrated, allowing transudates and modified transudates to pass freely between the pleural spaces. [1]

In summary, diagnosis of pleuritis involves a combination of clinical signs, thoracocentesis, cytologic evaluation, and radiographic imaging. The aspiration and analysis of pleural fluid is essential to characterize the type of effusion and guide appropriate treatment.

## Treatment Options

Pleural effusion in cats requires prompt and aggressive treatment to stabilize the patient and address the underlying cause. The main components of treatment include:

[1] Therapeutic thoracocentesis: Removal of fluid from the pleural space to relieve respiratory distress. This should be performed cautiously to avoid complications.

[2] Antimicrobial therapy: Broad-spectrum antibiotics are typically initiated empirically and then adjusted based on culture and sensitivity results. Antibiotics with anaerobic coverage are important for cases of pyothorax.

[3] Pleural drainage: Placement of a thoracostomy tube to allow continuous or intermittent drainage of the pleural space. This facilitates fluid removal and allows for lavage.

[4] Pleural lavage: Flushing the pleural space with sterile saline or Ringer's solution to remove exudates and debris. This is typically done 1-2 times daily.

[5] Surgical intervention: Some cases may require thoracotomy to address loculated fluid, abscesses, lung lobe consolidation, or other complications that do not resolve with medical management. Procedures like mediastinectomy or decortication may be needed.

The prognosis depends on the underlying cause, with pyothorax, FIP, and neoplasia generally having a more guarded outlook compared to cases of congestive heart failure or idiopathic chylothorax. Prompt and aggressive treatment is crucial, but some cats may still succumb to the primary disease process.

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination strategies and environmental management techniques can help prevent pleuritis in dogs:

[1] Vaccination against common respiratory pathogens, such as canine distemper virus and canine influenza virus, may help reduce the risk of developing pleuritis as a secondary infection. [2] Proper hygiene and sanitation in the dog's environment, including regular disinfection of surfaces, can limit the spread of bacterial and fungal agents that may cause pleuritis. [3] Prompt treatment of any primary respiratory infections or wounds that could lead to pleural contamination is important to prevent progression to pleuritis.

## Differential Diagnosis

Pleural effusion can have similar radiographic presentations to several other respiratory diseases, so it is important to consider other potential causes.

Pneumothorax can also lead to increased radiolucency of the thoracic cavity and blunting of the diaphragmatic angles, similar to pleural effusion. However, in pneumothorax the lung margins will be sharper and better defined, and there may be increased visibility of the mediastinal structures. [1]

Pulmonary edema, whether cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic in origin, can also result in increased soft tissue opacity within the thoracic cavity. However, the opacification will be within the lung parenchyma rather than the pleural space. Signs of pulmonary edema include an unstructured interstitial pattern that progresses to an alveolar pattern, as well as enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in cases of cardiogenic edema. [2,3]

Mediastinal masses or neoplasia can also displace the lung margins and lead to pleural effusion, often in a unilateral distribution. In these cases, the mass itself may be visible on radiographs. [1]

Trauma, such as diaphragmatic hernia or rib fractures, can allow fluid or air to accumulate in the pleural space. Careful evaluation of the bony thorax and diaphragm is important in these cases. [1]

Finally, certain infectious processes like pyothorax can directly lead to an exudative pleural effusion. The effusion may have a distinct appearance and be associated with other signs of infection. [1]

In summary, the differential diagnosis for pleural effusion includes pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, mediastinal masses, trauma, and infectious processes. Careful evaluation of the radiographic patterns, as well as integration with the patient's signalment and clinical signs, is crucial to differentiate these conditions.
