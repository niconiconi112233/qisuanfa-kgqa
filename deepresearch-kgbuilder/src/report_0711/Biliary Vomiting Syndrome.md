## Disease Overview

Biliary Vomiting Syndrome (BVS) is a condition commonly observed in older dogs, characterized by early morning vomiting of bile without food [1]. The condition is thought to result from reflux of duodenal fluid into the gastric lumen, leading to bile in the stomach and subsequent gastric mucosal irritation and vomiting [1,2]. 

BVS is not well-characterized, but appears to involve abnormal gastrointestinal motility, local gastritis, or stimulation of the emetic center [2]. It is typically seen in young, mixed-breed, castrated male dogs with a chronic history of vomiting bile [2]. 

Epidemiological studies have found that BVS most commonly affects older dogs, with no clear breed or gender predilection [2]. The condition is likely underdiagnosed, as dogs with BVS rarely receive a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to rule out other causes of chronic vomiting [2].

## Common Pathogens

Biliary Vomiting Syndrome in dogs can have a variety of underlying causes, including:

[1] Viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections that irritate the digestive tract, such as Giardia or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These conditions can lead to duodenal reflux, where contents from the small intestine back up into the stomach, causing irritation and vomiting of bile. [1]

[2] Motility issues in the gastrointestinal tract that delay stomach emptying and cause bile buildup. This can occur secondary to other diseases like kidney disease, liver disease, or hyperthyroidism. [3,4]

[3] Food intolerances or allergies that lead to chronic inflammation and altered GI motility. [3,4] 

In cats, Biliary Vomiting Syndrome is less common, but may also be associated with conditions like inflammatory bowel disease that impact the duodenum and cause bile reflux. [2]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Bilious vomiting syndrome (BVS) in dogs is characterized by vomiting yellow or green fluid, often in the early morning hours or after a long period without eating. The vomiting is typically accompanied by signs of nausea, such as excessive drooling or licking of the lips, but the dog may otherwise appear healthy and alert [1].

The classic symptom of BVS is vomiting on an empty stomach. This occurs because the stomach is empty, allowing bile and gastric fluids to accumulate and irritate the stomach lining, leading to nausea and vomiting [2]. Dogs with BVS do not usually display other clinical signs like lethargy, weight loss, or diarrhea [3].

It's important to note that vomiting yellow fluid can also be a sign of other underlying conditions, so a veterinary examination is recommended to rule out other potential causes and properly diagnose BVS [3].

## Diagnostic Methods

Biliary Vomiting Syndrome (BVS) in dogs is typically diagnosed based on the clinical presentation, including [1]:

- Vomiting of yellow or green fluid, often in the early morning or after a prolonged period without eating
- Nausea symptoms like lip smacking, drooling
- Temporary reduction in appetite

To rule out other potential causes, veterinarians may recommend additional diagnostic tests [1,2]:

- Blood work 
- Urinalysis
- Fecal examination
- Abdominal X-rays
- Abdominal ultrasound
- Endoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract

The goal of these tests is to ensure there are no other underlying medical conditions causing the chronic vomiting. If no other issues are identified, BVS is often the likely diagnosis [1,2].

## Treatment Options

Biliary Vomiting Syndrome in dogs can be treated through a combination of dietary changes and medications. [1] First, feeding smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day instead of one or two large meals can help. Adding probiotics to improve gut health and eliminating any food allergens or sensitivities from the diet may also help. [1] 

Medications such as H2 blockers like famotidine, pepcid, or zantac can reduce stomach acid production. [1,2] Prokinetic agents that improve gastric motility may also be prescribed to help with acid reflux. [1] Sucralfate may be used short-term to help coat the irritated stomach and esophagus. [1]

If the vomiting is caused by an underlying condition like inflammatory bowel disease or giardiasis, treating the primary condition is important. [1,2] For dogs with giardiasis, anti-parasitic medications like fenbendazole and/or metronidazole will be needed, along with bathing the dog to remove any parasitic cysts. [1]

Overall, a combination of dietary management and medications is the typical treatment approach for Biliary Vomiting Syndrome in dogs. [1,2] Closely following the veterinarian's recommendations and monitoring the dog's progress is key to successfully managing this condition.

## Preventive Measures

One of the key preventive measures for Biliary Vomiting Syndrome (BVS) is proper dietary management. Feeding dogs a late evening meal or a small snack before bedtime can help reduce the amount of time the stomach is empty overnight, which can minimize bile reflux and subsequent vomiting. Additionally, providing a meal first thing in the morning may also help to alleviate BVS symptoms.[1]

Environmental management strategies can also play a role in preventing BVS. Maintaining a consistent feeding schedule and avoiding periods of extended fasting can help regulate the dog's digestive system and prevent the backflow of bile into the stomach.[2] Providing small, frequent meals may be more effective than large, infrequent meals for dogs prone to BVS.

Overall, a combination of dietary adjustments and environmental management is often the first line of defense against Biliary Vomiting Syndrome in dogs. Consulting with a veterinarian can help determine the most appropriate preventive measures for an individual dog.

## Differential Diagnosis

Bilious vomiting syndrome (BVS) in dogs can have similar symptoms to other gastrointestinal or metabolic disorders that must be ruled out. Some key differential diagnoses include:

[1] Dietary indiscretion or food allergies: Dogs that consume inappropriate foods or have food sensitivities may experience vomiting, especially on an empty stomach. [2]

[2] Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Chronic inflammation of the intestines can lead to vomiting, including bilious vomiting, as well as diarrhea and weight loss. [2]

[3] Pancreatitis: Inflammation of the pancreas can cause vomiting, especially after meals. It is often accompanied by abdominal pain. [2]

[4] Gastric or duodenal ulcers: Sores in the stomach or upper small intestine can irritate the lining and cause bilious vomiting. [2]

[5] Gastric neoplasia: Stomach or intestinal tumors may result in bilious vomiting, as well as weight loss and poor appetite. [3]

[6] Hepatic disease: Liver disorders can impair bile production and flow, potentially leading to bilious vomiting. [2]

Careful diagnostic evaluation, including bloodwork, imaging, and potentially endoscopy, is important to distinguish BVS from these other potential causes of vomiting in dogs. The response to dietary and medical management can also help confirm the diagnosis of BVS.

# Biliary Vomiting Syndrome

Biliary Vomiting Syndrome (BVS) is a common condition in older dogs, characterized by early morning vomiting of bile without food. While the exact cause is not well understood, it is thought to involve abnormal gastrointestinal motility, local gastritis, or stimulation of the emetic center. Veterinarians typically diagnose BVS based on the clinical presentation and rule out other potential underlying conditions through additional diagnostic tests.

## Summary

The key findings from this report include:

- BVS is associated with reflux of duodenal fluid into the gastric lumen, leading to bile in the stomach and subsequent gastritis and vomiting.
- Common contributing factors include viral/bacterial infections, motility issues, and food allergies that impact the digestive tract.
- Symptoms include early morning vomiting of yellow or green fluid, often accompanied by nausea but without other clinical signs.
- Diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions through blood work, imaging, and endoscopy.
- Treatment focuses on dietary management and medications to reduce stomach acid and improve gastric motility.

Proper dietary management and environmental controls are important preventive measures for dogs prone to BVS. By working closely with a veterinarian to identify and address the underlying cause, many dogs with BVS can find long-term relief from this chronic condition.
