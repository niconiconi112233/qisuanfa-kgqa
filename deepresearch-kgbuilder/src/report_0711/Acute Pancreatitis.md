## Disease Overview

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common and potentially life-threatening condition in companion animals, particularly dogs. [1] The reported mortality rate for AP in dogs ranges from 27% to 58%, though this rate may be questionable due to the referral-based nature of the studies. [1] In recent years, the diagnosis of pancreatitis has become more frequent, largely due to improved diagnostic modalities such as abdominal ultrasound. [2]

The etiology of AP in dogs is not fully understood, but it is often associated with dietary indiscretion, metabolic disorders, and various infectious causes. [3] A recent report found a prevalence of 34% for chronic pancreatitis in first-opinion cases, with 57% of those cases showing moderate to severe inflammation. [4] Ongoing research continues to shed light on the suspected risk factors and pathogenesis of pancreatitis in dogs. [5]

## Common Pathogens

The exact cause of acute pancreatitis in dogs and cats is often unknown, but several risk factors and potential triggers have been identified. [1] Dietary factors, such as a high-fat meal or getting into the garbage, can contribute to the development of pancreatitis. [2,4] Certain drugs, hormonal imbalances, and pancreatic tumors have also been cited as potential causes. [3,5] 

Additionally, some studies have suggested that hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing's disease) may be a risk factor for pancreatitis in dogs. [1] Trauma to the pancreas, backwash (reflux) of digestive enzymes, and genetic predisposition may also play a role in the etiology of acute pancreatitis. [3,5]

While the specific pathogens responsible for pancreatitis are not always clear, understanding these common risk factors and triggers can help veterinarians identify and manage the condition more effectively.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Acute pancreatitis in pets is characterized by a range of clinical symptoms and observable signs. The most common clinical signs include nausea, vomiting, fever, lethargy, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and decreased appetite [4]. These symptoms are typically caused by the inflammatory condition affecting the pancreas.

The pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis in pets is not well understood, and the causes and risk factors remain poorly defined [2,3,5]. The disease can be acute or chronic, and it can range from subclinical to severe, with a high mortality rate in some cases [3]. While the condition is usually sterile, the underlying mechanisms that trigger the inflammatory response are not yet fully elucidated [3].

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosing acute pancreatitis in dogs typically involves a combination of clinical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging techniques. [1] The primary laboratory test used is the serum canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (cPLI) concentration, which can indicate pancreatic inflammation. [1,2] Abdominal ultrasonography is also a valuable diagnostic tool, as it can help visualize the pancreas and detect signs of inflammation. [2,3] 

In some cases, more advanced imaging techniques like CT or MRI scans may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, especially if the initial tests are inconclusive. [3,4] Additionally, the dog's response to supportive treatment can provide further evidence to support the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. [2]

Overall, a multimodal approach utilizing the patient's history, clinical signs, laboratory results, and imaging findings is the most effective way to diagnose acute pancreatitis in canine patients. [5]

## Treatment Options

The mainstay of treating acute pancreatitis in dogs is supportive care, including fluid therapy and nutritional management. [1] Fluid therapy that is tailored to the patient's needs is crucial to provide adequate hydration while preventing overhydration. [4] Antiemetics are commonly used to manage vomiting and nausea, with maropitant being a first-line option. [1,3] Analgesics such as opioids are important for managing abdominal pain. [1] 

For dogs with more severe pancreatitis, additional treatments may be warranted. Antibiotic therapy is generally not recommended unless there are signs of infection. [4] Glucocorticoids have shown some benefits but their use remains controversial. [1,4] Plasma transfusions and surgical intervention are other potential treatments in severe, refractory cases. [1,4]

Long-term management focuses on dietary modification to a low-fat diet and monitoring for complications like diabetes or pancreatic insufficiency. [1,3] Prevention involves avoiding dietary indiscretion and managing any underlying conditions that increase pancreatitis risk.

## Preventive Measures

Proper dietary management and environmental control are crucial for preventing acute pancreatitis in pets. Feeding a low-fat, moderate-protein diet is recommended to meet the animal's nutritional needs without overstimulating the pancreas [1,2,4]. Hydrolyzed diets may also be considered, as they can help reduce pancreatic inflammation [2]. 

Additionally, it is important to avoid feeding table scraps or other high-fat foods, as these can trigger acute pancreatitis episodes [3,4]. Maintaining a stable, stress-free environment for the pet is also crucial, as stress can be a contributing factor to pancreatitis [5].

Regular veterinary checkups and prompt treatment of any underlying conditions that may predispose the pet to pancreatitis, such as hypothyroidism or hyperlipidemia, can also help prevent the development of acute pancreatitis [4].

## Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating a patient for acute pancreatitis, it is important to consider a broad differential diagnosis. Some common conditions that can present with similar clinical signs include [1]:

- Acute gastritis or enteritis - Vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are common in these conditions as well.
- Dietary indiscretion - Eating a fatty meal can trigger acute pancreatitis.
- Parasites like hookworms - Can cause gastrointestinal signs.
- Gastrointestinal foreign body or obstruction - Vomiting and abdominal pain are typical.
- Intussusception - An invagination of the intestine that can lead to obstruction.
- Infectious diseases like parvovirus or distemper - Often present with vomiting and diarrhea.
- Metabolic disorders like diabetes mellitus or hypoadrenocorticism - Can have overlapping clinical signs.
- Abdominal neoplasia - May cause vomiting, inappetence, and abdominal pain.

Differentiating acute pancreatitis from these other conditions requires a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including bloodwork, imaging, and potentially exploratory surgery. No single test is definitive, so integrating the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results is key to reaching an accurate diagnosis [2,3,4].
