## Disease Overview

Angioedema is a type of allergic reaction that results in rapid swelling of the skin, face, lips, tongue, or throat in dogs and cats. It is believed to be caused by a type-1 hypersensitivity and IgE-mediated degranulation of mast cells.[1] Allergies are the most common cause of angioedema, but it can also be triggered by other factors such as infections, illnesses like lupus or leukemia, and insect bites.[2,3] 

Urticaria (hives) and angioedema often occur together as part of an acute hypersensitivity reaction in pets.[4] Differential diagnoses for angioedema include other conditions that can cause swelling, such as bacterial cellulitis, granulomatous dermatitis, and snakebite.[5] Prompt veterinary treatment is important, as angioedema can potentially obstruct the airway if it occurs in the throat.

## Common Pathogens

Angioedema in companion animals is typically caused by acute hypersensitivity reactions, rather than specific viral or bacterial pathogens.[1] Allergies are the most frequent cause of angioedema, with triggers including environmental allergens, food ingredients, and medications.[2] In some cases, angioedema may also be associated with underlying illnesses such as lupus or leukemia.[2] 

Urticaria and angioedema are generally immunological reactions, often involving type I hypersensitivity.[3] They are localized forms of a systemic reaction called anaphylaxis. Differential diagnoses for angioedema include bacterial cellulitis, sterile granulomatous dermatitis, snakebite, and other conditions that can cause rapid swelling.[5] While pathogens are not a common direct cause, angioedema may sometimes arise secondary to an infection or inflammatory process.[4]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Angioedema is a common skin reaction in dogs and cats that is characterized by localized, asymmetrical swelling of the skin and mucous membranes [1]. The swelling typically develops within minutes to a few hours after exposure to an allergen [1]. In severe cases, the edema can become diffuse, causing gross swelling of entire body regions such as the limbs, face, or head [2]. 

The swelling associated with angioedema is often accompanied by erythema (redness) and pruritus (itchiness) [5]. In some cases, the angioedema may progress to anaphylaxis, a life-threatening systemic allergic reaction [5]. Angioedema can also lead to laryngeal edema, which can cause respiratory distress [5]. 

While angioedema is typically caused by acute hypersensitivity reactions, non-immunological factors may also contribute to the development of this condition in animals [4].

## Diagnostic Methods

The diagnosis of angioedema in pets typically involves a combination of clinical assessment and laboratory testing. Potential differential diagnoses that need to be ruled out include juvenile cellulitis, infected cellulitis, snake bite, edema, lymphedema, and neoplasia [1].

The clinical presentation of angioedema is characterized by acute-onset, pruritic wheals or swelling in the subcutaneous tissue [2]. A thorough history and physical examination are crucial to evaluate the pattern and timeline of the swelling, as well as any potential triggers or underlying conditions.

Laboratory testing may include allergy testing, blood work to assess for underlying inflammatory or immune-mediated conditions, and potentially imaging studies to rule out other causes of edema [3]. In some cases, a trial of antihistamine or corticosteroid therapy can help confirm the diagnosis based on the patient's response [4].

Diagnosing the underlying cause of angioedema, whether it is an allergic reaction, adverse drug reaction, or other trigger, is an important step in developing an appropriate treatment plan [5].

## Treatment Options

For dogs and cats experiencing angioedema, a combination of medication and supportive care is typically recommended. Initial treatment often involves administering antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, at a dose of 2-4 mg/kg orally or 1-2 mg/kg intramuscularly.[1] Glucocorticoids, like prednisone (0.5 mg/kg orally) or dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg intramuscularly or intravenously), may also be prescribed to reduce inflammation and swelling.[2,3] 

In addition to pharmacological interventions, supportive care is crucial. This includes providing intravenous fluids, monitoring the patient's airway, and addressing any underlying allergic triggers.[1,2] Nursing interventions, such as keeping the patient calm and comfortable, can also aid in the management of angioedema.

## Preventive Measures

To prevent angioedema in pets, vaccination protocols and environmental management strategies are crucial. In dogs and cats, post-vaccination angioedema is believed to be caused by a type-1 hypersensitivity and IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation in the skin [1,2]. Therefore, pets with a prior history of post-vaccinal angioedema should be closely monitored, and alternative vaccination schedules or products may be considered [1]. 

Additionally, the use of allergen extracts for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes can also trigger urticaria or angioedema in dogs [3]. Owners should be aware of potential triggers and work closely with their veterinarian to identify and manage these environmental factors. Generally, urticaria and angioedema respond well to prompt treatment with glucocorticoids and antihistamines [4]. In severe cases, pets may require supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, and other supportive care [5].

## Differential Diagnosis

Angioedema, a condition characterized by sudden, swollen skin and mucous membranes, can be challenging to diagnose due to its similarity to other diseases. Potential differential diagnoses include juvenile cellulitis, infected cellulitis, snake bite, edema, lymphedema, and neoplasia.[1] Bacterial cellulitis and sterile granulomatous dermatitis and lymphadenitis (juvenile cellulitis) are also important considerations.[2] 

In cats and dogs, post-vaccinal angioedema, or swelling of the face and ears, is a known adverse event that can occur after vaccination.[3] Additionally, some patients presenting with angioedema-like symptoms may have swelling and skin lesions attributable to other causes, although these are uncommon.[4]

Careful evaluation of the patient's history, clinical signs, and diagnostic tests are crucial to distinguish angioedema from these potential masqueraders and ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.[5]

# Pet Disease: Angioedema

Angioedema is a concerning allergic reaction in dogs and cats that causes rapid swelling of the skin, face, and airways. This report synthesizes the latest research on angioedema, covering its underlying causes, clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods, treatment options, and preventive measures. Key insights include the role of type-1 hypersensitivity reactions, the importance of prompt veterinary care to manage airway risks, and strategies to identify and mitigate environmental triggers. By understanding this condition, pet owners and veterinarians can work together to safeguard the health and wellbeing of companion animals.

## Summary

Angioedema in pets is primarily driven by acute allergic reactions, often triggered by environmental allergens, food ingredients, or medications. Rapid swelling of the skin and mucous membranes is the hallmark clinical sign, which can potentially progress to life-threatening airway obstruction. Diagnosis involves a combination of physical examination, allergy testing, and ruling out other causes of edema. Treatment focuses on administering antihistamines and corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, along with supportive care. Preventing angioedema requires vigilance around potential triggers, including during vaccination. By working closely with veterinarians, pet owners can implement strategies to identify and manage this concerning condition.
