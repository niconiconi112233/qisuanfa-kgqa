## Disease Overview

Hepatozoonosis is a tick-borne disease in companion animals caused by the protozoan parasites Hepatozoon canis and Hepatozoon americanum. H. canis is the causative agent of Old World hepatozoonosis, which is reported in many regions globally, including Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, Europe, and South America [1]. In North America, the more severe form of the disease, American canine hepatozoonosis (ACH), is caused by H. americanum and transmitted by the Gulf Coast tick (Amblyomma maculatum) [2,3]. 

While H. canis infection often leads to mild to moderate clinical disease, H. americanum infection typically results in a severe syndrome with symptoms like fever, muscle atrophy, pain, and weakness [4,5]. Diagnosis involves detecting the parasites in blood or tissue samples, and treatment involves antiprotozoal medications, supportive care, and tick control measures [5]. Hepatozoonosis is considered a lifelong infection in dogs, as complete parasite clearance is difficult to achieve [5].

## Common Pathogens

Hepatozoonosis in dogs is caused by two main species of the protozoan parasite *Hepatozoon*:

1. *Hepatozoon canis*: This species is found in the Old World, including parts of Asia, Africa, Europe, and South America. It is transmitted by the brown dog tick *Rhipicephalus sanguineus*. Infection with *H. canis* can range from asymptomatic to severe disease with anemia, lethargy, and cachexia. [1,2]

2. *Hepatozoon americanum*: This species is found in the southern United States and is transmitted by the Gulf Coast tick *Amblyomma maculatum*. *H. americanum* infection typically causes a severe disease with fever, muscle pain, lameness, and high neutrophil counts. It is considered an emerging disease that is spreading northward from Texas. [1,2,3]

Both *H. canis* and *H. americanum* are transmitted when dogs ingest infected ticks. The parasites then invade mononuclear cells and disseminate to various tissues where they undergo merogony and gametogony. Ticks become infected when feeding on parasitemic dogs. [1,2]

In addition to these two main *Hepatozoon* species, there have been rare reports of other *Hepatozoon* species infecting dogs, such as *H. silvestris* in Europe. Concurrent infections with other pathogens like *Ehrlichia*, *Toxoplasma*, and *Leishmania* have also been documented in dogs with hepatozoonosis. [1,4,5]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Dogs infected with *Hepatozoon canis* often show mild to moderate clinical signs, such as fever, lethargy, depression, and anemia [1]. Unlike infections with *H. americanum*, dogs with *H. canis* do not appear to be in pain at presentation. The tissue stages of *H. canis* reside primarily within the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen.

In contrast, *H. americanum* infections typically result in a severe clinical syndrome known as American canine hepatozoonosis (ACH) [1]. Dogs with ACH commonly exhibit fever, mucopurulent ocular discharge, intense pain, muscle atrophy, and elevated neutrophil counts. The tissue phases of *H. americanum* induce pyogranulomatous inflammation, which leads to the observed clinical signs of pain, weakness, and muscle wasting. Fever may fluctuate and is unresponsive to antibiotics. Surprisingly, many dogs with ACH maintain a normal appetite if food is placed directly in front of them, but are reluctant to move due to the intense pain.

## Diagnostic Methods

The diagnosis of hepatozoonosis in cats can be made through several laboratory testing and imaging approaches:

[1] Observation of parasite gamonts in blood smears stained with Diff-Quick or May-Grunwald Giemsa methods can reveal the presence of Hepatozoon parasites within neutrophils and monocytes. The Hepatozoon felis gamonts have an ellipsoidal shape and are 10.5 x 4.7 μm in size [1].

[2] Detection of parasite meronts in muscle biopsies through histopathology can also provide a diagnosis. The meronts are round to oval parasites surrounded by a thick membrane with a length of 39 x 34.5 μm [1]. 

[3] Molecular detection of Hepatozoon DNA in blood or tissue samples using PCR is considered the diagnostic test of choice, as it has higher sensitivity compared to blood smears which often fail to detect low-level parasitemia [1,2].

[4] Radiographic imaging may reveal periosteal reactions and bony proliferation in cats with American canine hepatozoonosis caused by Hepatozoon silvestris, although this has not been commonly reported in feline cases [1].

## Treatment Options

Dogs infected with Hepatozoon organisms can be treated with medications that will decrease the severity of the symptoms, but return of symptoms is common. Treatment is more difficult to control in *H. americanum* than *H. canis* infections.[1]

For *H. canis* infections, the treatment of choice is imidocarb dipropionate at 5-6 mg/kg every 14 days until gamonts are no longer present in blood smears. Oral doxycycline at 10 mg/kg/day for 21 days may also be used in combination with imidocarb dipropionate.[1] 

For *H. americanum* infections, a combination oral therapy of trimethoprim/sulfa (15 mg/kg every 12 hours), pyrimethamine (0.25 mg/kg every 24 hours), and clindamycin (10 mg/kg every 8 hours) is used. After remission from clinical signs is obtained, the coccidiostat decoquinate at 10-20 mg/kg mixed in the food every 12 hours can be given to help prolong the remission.[1]

Supportive care, including anti-inflammatory medications to control pain or fever and intravenous fluids if the dog is not eating or drinking well, may also be required.[1,2]

## Preventive Measures

The most effective method of preventing hepatozoonosis is to prevent tick exposure. Ensure that your dog is protected with an effective, veterinarian-recommended tick preventive. [1] Since hepatozoonosis can also be acquired through the ingestion of prey species, limiting your dog's hunting and scavenging will further decrease the risk of infection. [1]

Vaccination and environmental management are not viable preventive measures for hepatozoonosis, as there is no commercially available vaccine and the parasite is transmitted through ingestion of infected ticks or prey rather than via the environment. [2,3] The key prevention strategies are therefore centered around tick control and limiting your dog's access to potential sources of infection.

## Differential Diagnosis

Other diseases that should be considered in the differential diagnosis for hepatozoonosis include:

- Canine leishmaniasis: This protozoan infection can cause nonspecific clinical signs like fever, lethargy, weight loss, and lameness, similar to hepatozoonosis. It is transmitted by sandflies rather than ticks. [1]

- Ehrlichiosis: An infectious disease caused by the bacteria Ehrlichia that can lead to fever, lethargy, lameness, and other symptoms overlapping with hepatozoonosis. It is also transmitted by ticks. [2]  

- Babesiosis: A tick-borne illness caused by Babesia parasites that can cause anemia, fever, and weakness in dogs, mimicking some hepatozoonosis presentations. [3]

- Neosporosis: An infection by the protozoan Neospora caninum that can cause neurological signs, muscle atrophy, and lameness in dogs. [4]

- Toxoplasmosis: Another protozoal disease that may cause similar clinical signs like fever, lethargy, and neurological disorders in some cases. [4]

Careful history taking, physical examination, and laboratory testing are important to distinguish hepatozoonosis from these other tick-borne and protozoal diseases that have overlapping clinical presentations. Definitive diagnosis often requires identifying the parasite microscopically or through molecular techniques.

# Pet Disease: Hepatozoonosis

Hepatozoonosis is a tick-borne disease that affects companion animals, primarily dogs and cats. Caused by the protozoan parasites Hepatozoon canis and Hepatozoon americanum, this condition can manifest in varying degrees of severity depending on the infecting species. While H. canis often leads to mild to moderate symptoms, H. americanum can result in a severe syndrome known as American canine hepatozoonosis, marked by debilitating pain, muscle atrophy, and weakness. Timely diagnosis through laboratory testing and effective treatment with antiprotozoal medications are crucial for managing this complex and potentially life-threatening disease.

## Conclusion

Hepatozoonosis poses a significant threat to the health and wellbeing of companion animals, particularly dogs. The two primary causative agents, H. canis and H. americanum, can lead to vastly different clinical presentations, with the latter causing a severe, debilitating syndrome. Accurate diagnosis through blood smears, tissue biopsies, and molecular testing is essential for guiding appropriate treatment, which often involves a combination of antiprotozoal drugs and supportive care. Preventing tick exposure through the use of effective preventatives remains the cornerstone of reducing the risk of hepatozoonosis in pets. As this disease continues to emerge and spread, veterinary professionals must stay vigilant in their efforts to identify, manage, and control this complex tick-borne infection.
