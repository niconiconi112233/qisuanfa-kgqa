## Disease Overview

Dermatophilosis is a bacterial skin infection caused by the bacterium *Dermatophilus congolensis*. It is a disease that affects a wide variety of mammalian species, including cattle, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, and even humans. 

The disease is most common in young or immunosuppressed animals, and in animals chronically exposed to wet conditions. Clinical signs include matted hair, crusty lesions, and wartlike lesions that can occur over large areas of the body. Diagnosis is typically made through cytological examination of the lesions or bacterial culture.

Dermatophilosis has a worldwide geographic distribution, but is more common in tropical environments with heavy rainfall and high humidity. It is believed to spread through direct contact between animals, contaminated environments, or possibly via biting insects. Clinically normal, chronically infected animals are considered the primary reservoir.

The disease is treated with systemic antimicrobials, topical therapy, and changes in husbandry to keep animals dry. Environmental cleaning to remove organic material and hair is also important. Dermatophilosis is a zoonotic disease, and can be transmitted to humans through direct contact with infected animals.

## Common Pathogens of Dermatophilosis

Dermatophilosis is a bacterial skin disease caused primarily by the pathogen *Dermatophilus congolensis*. This gram-positive, non-acid-fast actinomycete bacteria is the main causative agent of dermatophilosis in companion animals [1].

Other pathogens that can rarely cause dermatophilosis include *Austwickia chelonae* (formerly *Dermatophilus chelonae*), which is adapted to infect poikilotherms like reptiles and amphibians [1]. *Dermatophilus crocodyli* has also been proposed as a novel species that can infect farmed saltwater crocodiles [1].

Domestic animals most commonly affected by dermatophilosis include cattle, sheep, goats, and horses [2,4]. Pigs, dogs, and cats are less frequently infected [2,3]. Dermatophilosis is rare in humans but can occur through direct contact with infected animals [2,5].

The bacteria typically infect areas of the skin where the natural protective barriers have been compromised, such as by trauma, ectoparasites, or chronic moisture exposure [1]. Once established, the bacteria can spread from the initial site of infection to other areas of the skin.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Dermatophilosis is a bacterial skin infection that can affect dogs and cats. The common clinical presentation includes:

[1] Crusty, scabby lesions on the skin, often with underlying pus or exudates [1,2]
[2] Gray-yellow, circular crusts or bumps that may resemble hives [2] 
[3] Hair loss and redness in the affected areas [1,2]
[4] Discomfort and itchiness in the infected regions [1,2]

The lesions are typically found on the body, head, or extremities, and the infection can spread to new areas of the skin over time. Outbreaks often occur during rainy seasons when the skin is chronically wet and macerated [3,4]. While dermatophilosis usually heals within 2-3 weeks without treatment, severe generalized infections can lead to weight loss, reduced mobility, and secondary bacterial infections [3,4].

## Diagnostic Methods

Dermatophilosis can be diagnosed through a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory testing, and imaging.

Clinical evaluation involves assessing the appearance of lesions, which typically include matted hair, crusty scabs, and wartlike lesions. The distribution of lesions, often on the dorsum and legs, can provide clues to the diagnosis.

Laboratory testing is the primary means of confirming dermatophilosis. The most practical diagnostic test is cytological examination of fresh crusts and impression smears from lesions. Under oil immersion, the bacteria appear as 2-6 parallel rows of gram-positive cocci, resembling railroad tracks [1]. 

Definitive diagnosis can also be made through bacterial culture, where the characteristic branching filaments and spores of *Dermatophilus congolensis* can be identified [2]. PCR assays can detect the presence of fungal DNA, though they cannot distinguish between viable and non-viable organisms [3].

While imaging is not typically required for diagnosis, histological examination of affected skin may reveal the branching hyphae, coccoid cells, and zoospores of the bacteria within the epidermis [4].

In summary, dermatophilosis is most reliably diagnosed through a combination of clinical signs and laboratory confirmation, either through cytology, culture, or PCR. Imaging may provide supportive evidence in atypical cases.

## Treatment Options

Dermatophilosis, a bacterial skin infection caused by Dermatophilus congolensis, can be managed through a combination of medical and supportive care treatments. [1] Horses diagnosed with dermatophilosis are typically treated with a single intramuscular injection of penicillin and streptomycin antibiotics. [1] Topical treatments such as antibiotic sprays, washes, and rinses are also commonly used to reduce the spread of infection. [1] Scabs should be soaked in antiseptic solutions like betadine or chlorhexidine, then gently brushed or rinsed away. [1] The affected animal should then be moved to a clean, dry, well-ventilated environment. [1] Additionally, controlling biting insects is important to prevent recurrence of dermatophilosis. [1] In mild cases, the infection may resolve spontaneously within 2-4 weeks without treatment. [1] However, in chronic or severe cases, repeated treatment with injectable antimicrobials and topical therapies may be required to fully clear the infection. [2,3]

## Preventive Measures

Appropriate and timely vaccination is an essential preventive measure for dermatophilosis in areas where the vaccine is available for use in cattle and other susceptible species [1]. Isolating clinically affected animals and controlling ectoparasites like ticks and lice are also important strategies to break the infectious cycle and prevent the spread of the disease [3]. 

Keeping animals dry and minimizing chronic moisture exposure on the skin is crucial, as moisture facilitates the release of infective zoospores and their penetration into the epidermis [2,3]. Environmental management to prevent chronic wetting, such as providing adequate shelter, is an important part of controlling dermatophilosis outbreaks [3].

## Differential Diagnosis

Dermatophytosis, or ringworm, in dogs and cats can present with similar symptoms to other skin conditions that need to be ruled out. Some key differential diagnoses include:

[1] Staphylococcal bacterial folliculitis: This bacterial infection can cause papules, pustules, and crusting that resembles dermatophytosis. Cytological examination is needed to look for intracellular bacteria. [1]

[2] Demodicosis (mange): Circular areas of alopecia and crusting in dogs can be mistaken for dermatophytosis. Performing deep skin scrapings to identify the Demodex mites is important to differentiate this condition. [1]

[3] Other inflammatory or immune-mediated skin diseases: Conditions like pemphigus foliaceus can cause pustular lesions that are not oriented to the hair follicles, unlike dermatophytosis. Biopsy may be needed to rule these out. [1]

Overall, a stepwise diagnostic approach is crucial, including cytology, deep skin scrapings, fungal culture, and potentially biopsy, to differentiate dermatophytosis from other potential causes of skin disease in dogs and cats. [1]
