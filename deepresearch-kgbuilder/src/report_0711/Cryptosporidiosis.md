## Disease Overview

Cryptosporidiosis is a self-limited, gastrointestinal parasitic infection caused by the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium. [1] The disease is noteworthy in young ruminants, where it can cause severe, secretory diarrhea and fluid loss. [2] In companion animals like dogs and cats, cryptosporidiosis can also lead to acute, chronic, or intermittent diarrhea. [3] 

Cryptosporidium oocysts can infect animals immediately after being passed into the environment, so prompt removal and disposal of feces is crucial. [4] Studies have shown that the zoonotic transmission of Cryptosporidium between children and their household pets may be quite common. [5] Prevalence rates of Cryptosporidium infection in dogs and cats have been estimated to range from around 5-8%. [6] The use of molecular tools has led to the identification of several zoonotic Cryptosporidium species in companion animals. [7,8] Overall, the global prevalence of Cryptosporidium in cats and dogs is generally under 10%. [9]

## Common Pathogens

Cryptosporidiosis is an intestinal disease caused by a microscopic organism called Cryptosporidium, a coccidian-like protozoan parasite that can infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including dogs, cats, farm animals, and humans. [1] Cryptosporidium is transmitted through the fecal-oral route, with dogs and cats contracting the infection by ingesting contaminated water, food, or feces. [2,3] 

The primary species of Cryptosporidium that infect dogs and cats are Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium canis. [4] These parasites can cause chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and other gastrointestinal symptoms in infected animals. [1] Cryptosporidium can also be a zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans. [5]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Cryptosporidiosis in pets, particularly dogs and cats, is characterized by several common clinical symptoms and signs. The primary clinical sign is diarrhea, which can range from semi-formed to liquid in consistency and occur at an abnormal frequency [1,3]. Pets may also display intolerance to food, fever, and varying degrees of apathy, anorexia, and dehydration [2,5]. However, in most cases, the infections are self-limiting in immunocompetent and healthy animals [1,4]. Only rarely do severe dehydration, weakness, and collapse occur [5].

## Diagnostic Methods

Cryptosporidiosis in pets is primarily diagnosed based on the clinical presentation and laboratory testing. The most common symptoms include diarrhea and dehydration [1]. Cats may also exhibit fever, food intolerance, and lethargy [2]. However, it is important to note that many infected dogs and cats may not show any signs of illness [3].

To confirm the diagnosis, a fecal sample is examined under a microscope for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts [4]. This is typically done using a staining technique such as Ziehl-Neelsen staining [4]. In some cases, the infection may cause persistent, yellowish, watery, and mucoid diarrhea [4]. 

Infection with Cryptosporidium can lead to acute, chronic, or intermittent diarrhea in dogs and cats [5]. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential to manage the condition and prevent complications.

## Treatment Options

Cryptosporidiosis in companion animals can be challenging to treat, but a combination of medications, supportive care, and nursing approaches can help manage the infection. The only approved treatment for coccidiosis in the United States is sulfadimethoxine, which is administered at 50–60 mg/kg daily for 5–20 days in dogs and cats.[1] Antibiotics like tylosin or azithromycin have also been found to be effective in treating cryptosporidiosis, and may need to be given for 4 to 6 weeks.[2] 

For adult animals, a regimen of 100 mg of the antiprotozoal medication BID (twice a day) for 5 days has been approved for those 24 to 47 months old, and 200 mg BID for 5 days for animals 4 years and older.[4] In healthy animals, the infection may resolve without specific treatment, but supportive care with medications and fluid therapy can be helpful if dehydration or severe diarrhea is present.[5] Overall, a combination of targeted medications, hydration support, and good nursing care is typically required to manage cryptosporidiosis in companion animals.

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is one strategy that has been explored to protect animals against Cryptosporidium infection. Researchers have tested various approaches, including using hyperimmune colostrum [1], whole oocyst preparations, subunit vaccines, and DNA vaccines [2]. However, to date, effective vaccines against cryptosporidiosis have remained elusive [3,4]. 

Recently, a new vaccine based on the Gp40 antigen has shown promise in reducing Cryptosporidium parvum infection in pregnant cows, with the potential to protect their newborn calves through the transfer of antibodies [5]. This vaccine is the first of its kind and represents an important step towards developing effective preventive measures against this challenging parasite.

In addition to vaccination, environmental management strategies are crucial for controlling cryptosporidiosis. Maintaining proper hygiene, disinfecting surfaces, and implementing biosecurity measures can help reduce the risk of Cryptosporidium transmission [4].

## Differential Diagnosis

Cryptosporidiosis in dogs and cats can be confused with other gastrointestinal diseases that cause similar symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. [1] Some key differences to consider in the differential diagnosis include:

Giardiasis is another common intestinal parasite infection that can lead to similar gastrointestinal symptoms in pets. [2] However, Cryptosporidium tends to be more challenging to treat compared to Giardia. [3] 

Coccidiosis, caused by Cystoisospora species, is another parasitic disease seen in dogs and cats that can produce diarrhea. But Cryptosporidium is a distinct type of coccidia that infects the intestinal tract. [3]

Cryptosporidiosis is particularly important in young ruminant animals like calves and lambs, where it can cause severe diarrhea and growth issues. This is less common in companion animals like dogs and cats. [4]

Overall, while the symptoms may overlap, the specific causative parasite species and treatment approaches can differ significantly between cryptosporidiosis and other gastrointestinal diseases in pets. [5]
