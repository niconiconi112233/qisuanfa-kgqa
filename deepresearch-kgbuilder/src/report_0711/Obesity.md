## Disease Overview

Pet obesity is a growing concern, with studies estimating that up to 63% of pet cats and 59.3% of pet dogs are overweight or obese worldwide. [1] In the United States, the prevalence of overweight and obese pets has been steadily increasing, reaching 59% of dogs and 61% of cats classified as such in 2022. [2,3] Obesity in pets is linked to various health problems, including osteoarthritis, feline diabetes, and a shorter lifespan. [1,4] Factors contributing to pet obesity include neutering, age of both the owner and the animal, and owners' failure to recognize their pets' abnormal body condition. [1,5] Addressing pet obesity is crucial for maintaining the overall health and well-being of our furry companions.

## Causes and Risk Factors

Obesity in companion animals is a complex issue with multiple contributing factors. One of the primary causes is diet, including consuming low-quality food, leftovers, and frequent treats.[1][2][5] Certain breeds, such as Shetland Sheepdogs, Golden Retrievers, and Labrador Retrievers, also appear to be more genetically predisposed to weight gain.[4] 

Additionally, lifestyle factors play a significant role. Older, neutered pets are at a higher risk of becoming overweight or obese, likely due to decreased activity levels and metabolic changes.[3] The presence of multiple pets in the household has also been identified as an environmental risk factor.[5]

Underlying medical conditions, such as endocrine disorders or joint problems, can further exacerbate the issue by reducing a pet's mobility and ability to exercise.[2] The extra weight can also worsen existing conditions, such as arthritis, by placing additional stress on the animal's bones and joints.[1]

Addressing obesity in companion animals requires a comprehensive approach, including careful dietary management, increased physical activity, and addressing any underlying medical concerns.

## Clinical Symptoms and Diagnosis

Obesity in dogs and cats is characterized by several physical signs and symptoms. Overweight pets often exhibit weight gain, lack of endurance, and difficulty breathing.[1,2] They may also have a distended abdomen, lack a visible waistline, and have difficulty moving or playing.[3,4] Cats may show reluctance to groom themselves and a refusal to move or play.[4] 

Veterinarians typically diagnose obesity through a combination of assessing the pet's body weight and using a body condition scoring (BCS) system, which ranges from 1 (underweight) to 9 (obese).[7,10] Cats with a BCS over 7 and the presence of additional factors like low adiponectin levels or hyperlipidemia may be diagnosed with "obesity disease".[8] Overall, a thorough physical examination and diagnostic tests are used to identify obesity and rule out other underlying medical conditions.

## Treatment Approaches

Managing and reversing obesity in pets requires a comprehensive approach involving medical, dietary, and lifestyle-based interventions. A high-protein, high-fiber diet has been shown to be effective in promoting weight loss in obese dogs, with studies demonstrating greater weight loss compared to standard diets [1]. Consultation with a veterinarian is crucial to develop an individualized weight management plan.

Medications such as dirlotapide (Slentrol), approved by the FDA in 2007, can also be used to treat obesity in dogs by reducing appetite and food intake [3]. Conventional weight loss programs involving dietary calorie restriction have also been highly successful, with rates of weight loss up to 2.6% per week reported in obese colony dogs [4].

Alongside dietary changes, increasing physical activity is essential for supporting weight loss and maintaining a healthy weight in pets. Strategies such as measuring food accurately, limiting treats, and adding low-impact exercises like swimming can help pet owners effectively manage their pet's weight [5].

## Prevention Strategies

Obesity is a significant health concern for companion animals, with up to 40% of dogs in the United States being overweight or obese [1]. Addressing this issue requires a multifaceted approach focused on proper nutrition, regular exercise, and owner education.

Genetics and breed predispositions play a role in canine obesity, with some breeds being more prone to weight gain [2]. However, the primary drivers are often related to owner behavior, such as overfeeding and lack of physical activity [3]. Owners should work closely with their veterinarians to develop a tailored diet and exercise plan for their pets, taking into account individual factors like age, activity level, and underlying health conditions.

Providing a balanced, calorie-appropriate diet and ensuring regular exercise are crucial for maintaining a healthy weight. Owners should also be aware of the risks associated with obesity, such as increased risk of cardiovascular disease, orthopedic problems, and metabolic disorders [3,4]. Educating owners on these health implications and empowering them to make informed decisions about their pet's care can be an effective strategy in preventing and managing obesity in companion animals [5].
