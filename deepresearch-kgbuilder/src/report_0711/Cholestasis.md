## Disease Overview

Cholestasis is a condition characterized by the impairment of bile flow, either from the liver to the gallbladder or from the gallbladder to the duodenum.[1] In companion animals, cholestasis can occur due to a variety of causes, including hepatobiliary disease, obstruction, or metabolic disorders.

Cholestasis is an uncommon finding in cats, but has been reported in the literature.[2] The prevalence and clinical relevance of cholelithiasis (gallstones) in cats is not well understood, but a recent study found that subclinical cholelithiasis may occur in a small number of apparently healthy shelter cats.[4] 

In dogs, subclinical bactibilia (the presence of bacteria in the bile) has also been reported, even in apparently healthy shelter dogs.[5] This suggests that some dogs may have underlying hepatobiliary abnormalities without overt clinical signs.

The epidemiology and pathogenesis of cholestasis in companion animals is not as well-characterized as in humans. Genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors likely play a role, as seen in the human condition of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.[3] Further research is needed to fully understand the etiology and risk factors for cholestasis in dogs and cats.

## Common Pathogens

Cholestasis, or impaired bile flow, can have a variety of underlying causes, including both viral and bacterial infections. Some of the key pathogens associated with cholestasis include:

[1] Bacterial infections: Sepsis from gram-positive or gram-negative organisms like E. coli can lead to cholestasis, likely through the action of inflammatory cytokines disrupting bile transport mechanisms. [1] Certain bacterial infections like actinomycosis, brucellosis, and leptospirosis can also directly infect the liver and bile ducts, leading to cholestasis. [2,3,4]

[2] Viral infections: Viruses like cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can cause cholestasis, especially in immunocompromised patients. CMV infection has been linked to neonatal biliary obstruction and sclerosing cholangitis in AIDS patients. [5,6] EBV reactivation in transplant recipients can also lead to cholestasis through post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. [7]

[3] Fungal infections: Invasive fungal infections like candidiasis, cryptococcosis, and histoplasmosis can infiltrate the liver and bile ducts, resulting in cholestasis. These are more common in immunocompromised hosts. [8]

[4] Mycobacterial infections: Tuberculosis and disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections can lead to granulomatous hepatitis and biliary obstruction, causing cholestasis. [9,10]

In summary, a wide range of viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens can contribute to the development of cholestasis in dogs, often through direct infection of the hepatobiliary system or via systemic inflammatory responses disrupting bile flow. A thorough diagnostic workup is important to identify the underlying infectious etiology.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Cholestasis in dogs can present with a variety of clinical symptoms and signs. Some of the most common include:

[1] Jaundice (icterus): Bile pigments accumulate in the body, leading to yellowing of the mucous membranes, skin, and whites of the eyes. This is a hallmark sign of cholestasis.[1]

[2] Abdominal pain: Dogs may exhibit signs of discomfort such as stretching, changing postures, pacing, and vocalizing, particularly after meals.[1] 

[3] Anorexia and vomiting: Diminished appetite and episodes of vomiting are frequently reported in dogs with cholestasis.[1]

[4] Fever and sepsis: Cholestasis may promote ascending biliary tract infections, leading to fever and other signs of systemic illness.[1]

The specific clinical presentation often depends on the underlying cause of the cholestasis, such as extrahepatic obstructions, intrahepatic disease, or cholangitis. However, many affected dogs may remain asymptomatic or show only non-specific signs. Careful diagnostic testing is required to determine the etiology and severity of the cholestatic condition.

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnostic approaches for cholestasis in dogs involve a combination of clinical tests, imaging, and other assessments to identify the underlying cause. 

Abnormal bile acid levels can indicate hepatic or circulatory issues, prompting further evaluation [1]. If bile acids are normal in an asymptomatic patient, a wait-and-recheck approach may be warranted before additional testing [1]. However, repeatedly elevated liver enzymes should prompt a systematic investigation [1].

Liver function tests like bilirubin, albumin, glucose, BUN, and cholesterol can provide insight into hepatic dysfunction [2-5]. Prolonged clotting times also suggest liver problems, as the liver produces most clotting factors [2-5]. The ammonia tolerance test can detect severe liver dysfunction or portosystemic shunting [2-5].

Abdominal ultrasonography is useful for identifying liver lesions, diffuse disease, or biliary abnormalities [1]. Fine needle aspiration of the liver can provide diagnostic information, though misinterpretation is possible and significant disease may be missed [1]. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard, and should be performed after coagulation profile assessment [1]. Sufficient clinical data should be provided to the pathologist to aid interpretation [1].

## Treatment Options

The treatment for cholestasis in dogs depends on the underlying cause, but typically involves a combination of medications, supportive care, and lifestyle modifications.

For infectious causes of cholestasis, appropriate antibiotics or antifungal medications are prescribed based on culture and sensitivity results.[1] Anti-inflammatory medications like corticosteroids may also be used to manage inflammation.[1] 

In cases of immune-mediated cholestasis, immunosuppressive drugs like corticosteroids, azathioprine, or cyclosporine are often prescribed.[1] The dose is gradually tapered over several months as the condition improves.

For cholestasis caused by copper accumulation, dietary copper restriction and chelation therapy with penicillamine or zinc are recommended.[1] Elemental zinc acetate can also be used to inhibit copper absorption.[1]

Supportive care for cholestasis includes providing a low-protein, high-carbohydrate diet to manage hepatic encephalopathy, administering medications to reduce bile acid levels and pruritus, and managing ascites through diuretics and fluid drainage.[1] 

In severe or end-stage cases, surgical interventions like liver biopsy, portosystemic shunt ligation, or liver transplantation may be considered.[1]

Ongoing monitoring through bloodwork and imaging is crucial to assess response to treatment and watch for potential complications.[1]

## Preventive Measures

Preventing cholestasis in pets involves a combination of vaccination, environmental management, and other strategies:

[1] Vaccination is an important preventive measure, as some underlying causes of cholestasis are infectious in nature. Vaccines can help protect against conditions like feline infectious peritonitis, which can lead to cholestatic liver disease. [2]

Environmental management is also key. Minimizing exposure to potential toxins and ensuring proper nutrition can help prevent cholestasis. This includes providing a diet low in copper for breeds predisposed to copper-associated hepatitis. [3]

Other preventive strategies include:

- Monitoring for and addressing conditions that can contribute to cholestasis, such as pancreatitis or inflammatory bowel disease in cats
- Providing antioxidant supplements like S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) or milk thistle to support liver health
- Using ursodeoxycholic acid to promote bile flow in cases of intrahepatic cholestasis
- Closely monitoring pets at increased risk, such as Bedlington terriers, and initiating early treatment for copper accumulation

By taking a comprehensive approach to prevention, pet owners and veterinarians can help minimize the risk of cholestasis and its associated complications. [4,5]

## Differential Diagnosis

Cholestasis, or impaired bile flow, can have a variety of underlying causes beyond just cholestasis itself. Some key differential diagnoses to consider include:

[1] Inflammatory diseases such as pancreatitis, cholecystitis, and cholangitis. These inflammatory conditions can obstruct bile ducts and lead to cholestasis. [1,2]

[2] Bile duct malformations or obstructions, such as choledochal cysts, biliary mucoceles, or gastrointestinal disease. Structural abnormalities or obstructions in the biliary system can impair bile flow. [1,2]

[3] Neoplasia affecting the biliary system, including biliary adenocarcinoma or metastatic tumors. Malignant growths can mechanically obstruct bile ducts. [1,2] 

[4] Parasitic infestations, such as liver flukes, which can cause inflammation and obstruction of the biliary tree. [1]

[5] Metabolic conditions like diabetes mellitus or lipidosis that can indirectly impact bile flow and liver function. [5]

[6] Infectious diseases affecting the liver, such as feline infectious peritonitis, calicivirus, or toxoplasmosis. These can cause liver damage and cholestasis. [5]

In summary, the differential for feline cholestasis includes a range of inflammatory, structural, neoplastic, parasitic, and metabolic disorders that can disrupt normal bile flow and liver function. A thorough diagnostic work-up is important to identify the underlying cause.

# Pet Disease: Cholestasis

Cholestasis is a condition characterized by the impairment of bile flow, which can have a variety of underlying causes in companion animals. This report synthesizes information on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnostic approaches, and treatment options for cholestasis in dogs and cats. Key findings include the role of infectious agents, metabolic disorders, and structural abnormalities in disrupting bile flow, as well as the importance of comprehensive testing and supportive care in managing this complex condition.

## Conclusion

Cholestasis is a multifaceted condition in pets, with potential viral, bacterial, fungal, and metabolic etiologies. Careful diagnostic workups involving blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsies are crucial for identifying the underlying cause and guiding appropriate treatment. Supportive care, such as dietary modifications and medication to reduce bile acid levels, is often necessary alongside addressing the primary disease process. While the epidemiology and pathogenesis of cholestasis in companion animals are not as well-characterized as in humans, ongoing research aims to improve our understanding and management of this challenging disorder.

| Comparative Factor | Canine Cholestasis | Feline Cholestasis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prevalence | More common than in cats | Less common |
| Common Causes | Sepsis, infectious hepatobiliary disease, metabolic disorders | Unclear, possibly similar to dogs |
