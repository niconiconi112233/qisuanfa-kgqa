## Disease Overview

Histoplasmosis is a chronic, non-contagious, disseminated, granulomatous disease caused by the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum var capsulatum [1,2]. The fungus is commonly found in soil contaminated with bird and bat feces, and is endemic to certain regions like the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys in the United States [1,2]. 

Histoplasmosis primarily affects humans and animals, though infection has been described in many species [1,2]. However, disease is uncommon to rare in all but dogs and cats [2]. Infection typically occurs via inhalation of the fungal spores, which then transform into the yeast form within the host's lungs and disseminate to other organs [1,2].

The clinical signs of histoplasmosis are nonspecific and can involve the respiratory, gastrointestinal, ocular, and neurological systems [1,2]. Common symptoms include weight loss, fever, pale mucous membranes, peripheral lymphadenopathy, tachypnea, diarrhea, and ocular lesions [1,2]. Diagnosis involves identifying the fungus in tissue samples or detecting antigen in bodily fluids [1,2]. Long-term treatment with antifungal medications is usually required, with varying prognosis depending on the extent of disease [1,2].

## Common Pathogens

Histoplasmosis is a fungal disease caused by the dimorphic fungus *Histoplasma capsulatum*. The fungus is commonly found in soil that contains bird and bat feces, particularly in areas along the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio river valleys in the United States. [1] 

The fungus can infect both humans and animals, including dogs and cats. Infection occurs through inhalation of the fungal spores. [2] While histoplasmosis has been reported in many animal species, it is most common in dogs and cats. [3]

Diagnosis of histoplasmosis is typically made through visualization of the fungal yeast forms in tissue samples or bodily fluids, as well as through antigen testing. Treatment involves long-term antifungal therapy such as itraconazole or fluconazole. [3]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Infected dogs and cats may present with a myriad of clinical signs, commonly including pyrexia, anorexia, and lethargy. [1] Histoplasmosis is an important differential diagnosis to consider in animals from endemic areas.

In dogs, acute disseminated histoplasmosis affects multiple organs, with a history of illness of only a few days' duration. Gastrointestinal involvement is common, with symptoms like large bowel diarrhea, hematochezia, and protein-losing enteropathy. [1] Less frequently, respiratory signs like cough or dyspnea may be present. [1] 

Cats with disseminated histoplasmosis often show nonspecific chronic signs like weight loss, pale mucous membranes, lethargy, fever, and anorexia. Respiratory signs like dyspnea and tachypnea occur in about 40% of cases. [1] Ocular involvement, including chorioretinitis and retinal detachment, is more common in cats compared to other species. [1]

## Diagnostic Methods

Histoplasmosis is a challenging disease to diagnose in pets due to its nonspecific clinical signs. However, there are several diagnostic tests and procedures that veterinarians can use to confirm a histoplasmosis diagnosis.

The definitive diagnosis is typically made by identifying the Histoplasma capsulatum yeast form in cytology or biopsy samples from affected tissues [1]. Fine-needle aspiration and exfoliative cytology can often detect the characteristic small, round yeast cells within phagocytes and giant cells. Tissue biopsy may be required if cytology is not conclusive.

Serological tests, such as the quantitative antigen ELISA on urine, serum, or cerebrospinal fluid, can also be helpful diagnostic tools. This test detects Histoplasma antigen and may be used to monitor response to treatment [1]. However, cross-reactivity with other fungal infections can occur.

Radiographic imaging, including thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound, may reveal nodular or diffuse patterns indicative of organ involvement, similar to metastatic cancer [2]. These imaging modalities can guide further diagnostic testing.

In summary, a combination of cytology/histopathology, serology, and diagnostic imaging is often required to confirm a histoplasmosis diagnosis in dogs and cats presenting with compatible clinical signs.

## Treatment Options

Itraconazole (10 mg/kg every 24 hours) is the treatment of choice for disseminated histoplasmosis in dogs and cats, although fluconazole is also effective.[1] For severe cases, concurrent treatment with amphotericin B or amphotericin B lipid complex is suggested.[1] Treatment duration depends on severity of disease, but a minimum of 6 months is recommended, with many patients requiring over 12 months of treatment.[1] Discontinuation of treatment should depend on resolution of clinical signs and urine antigen titers, as relapses occur in 10%-40% of patients.[1]

## Preventive Measures

To prevent histoplasmosis infection in companion animals, it is important to take precautions against environmental exposure. Monitor your pet's outdoor activities and avoid areas with high concentrations of bird or bat droppings, such as old wooden buildings or caves.[1] Inhaling dust from disturbed soil or decaying organic matter containing these fungal spores is the primary mode of transmission.[2] 

While there is no reliable way to completely eliminate the fungus from the environment, be cautious when cleaning up any bat or bird feces, especially in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.[3] Wear protective equipment like gloves and a mask to avoid inhaling the spores.[3] Regular environmental sanitation and limiting your pet's access to high-risk areas can help reduce their chances of contracting this disease.

## Differential Diagnosis

Histoplasmosis is an important differential diagnosis to consider in dogs and cats presenting with nonspecific clinical signs such as weight loss, fever, respiratory distress, or gastrointestinal signs. While histoplasmosis can affect many body systems, it shares similarities with several other diseases that must be ruled out.

In dogs, histoplasmosis should be differentiated from other systemic fungal infections like blastomycosis and coccidioidomycosis, which can also cause disseminated disease [1]. Gastrointestinal signs may resemble inflammatory bowel disease, lymphoma, or other neoplastic processes affecting the intestines. Respiratory signs could be mistaken for bacterial pneumonia, lung cancer, or other respiratory diseases.

Cats with histoplasmosis may initially be misdiagnosed with conditions like feline lower urinary tract disease, toxoplasmosis, or feline infectious peritonitis due to the nonspecific clinical presentation [2]. Ocular disease from histoplasmosis can mimic other infectious or immune-mediated causes of uveitis and retinal detachment. Additionally, skeletal involvement may be confused with osteomyelitis from other etiologies.

Definitive diagnosis typically requires identification of the fungal organisms through cytology, histopathology, or culture of affected tissues [1,2]. While serology has limited reliability, antigen detection tests may aid in diagnosis, especially for monitoring response to treatment. Overall, a high index of suspicion is warranted in animals from endemic regions presenting with compatible clinical signs.
