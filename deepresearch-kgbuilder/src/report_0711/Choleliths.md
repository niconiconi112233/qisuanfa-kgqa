## Disease Overview

Cholelithiasis, also known as gallstones, refers to the presence of calculi or stones within the biliary system. It is an uncommon condition in companion animals, with cats being more frequently affected than dogs. 

The prevalence of cholelithiasis in cats has been reported to be 0.99% [1,2]. While the majority of cases are incidental findings on imaging, around 59% of cats with cholelithiasis develop clinically relevant symptoms [1]. These include signs of biliary tract obstruction, cholangitis, or concurrent hepatobiliary disease. 

Factors associated with the development of symptomatic cholelithiasis in cats include the presence of choleliths in multiple locations within the biliary tract and ultrasonographic evidence of biliary tract obstruction [1]. Concurrent hepatobiliary diseases, such as cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis, are suspected or confirmed in up to 83% of symptomatic cases [1]. 

In contrast, cholelithiasis is considered an uncommon but frequently incidental finding in dogs, with a prevalence around 0.97% [3]. The majority of dogs (86.9%) have asymptomatic, incidental cholelithiasis, with only a small percentage (13.1%) developing complications like biliary duct obstruction, biliary peritonitis, or cholecystitis [3].

## Common Pathogens

Choleliths, or gallstones, in dogs and cats can be associated with a variety of viral, bacterial, and other causative agents. Some key pathogens linked to the development of choleliths include:

[1] Bacterial infections: Choleliths can develop secondary to bacterial infections, particularly those involving the biliary tract such as cholangitis or cholecystitis. Common bacterial culprits include Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., and Klebsiella spp. [3,4]

[2] Viral infections: Canine adenovirus 1, which causes infectious canine hepatitis, can lead to chronic inflammation and scarring of the liver, predisposing to cholelith formation. Canine herpesvirus also causes severe, often fatal liver disease in puppies. [4]

[3] Ductal plate malformations: Animals with congenital biliary tract abnormalities like Caroli syndrome are predisposed to intrahepatic cholelithiasis and associated infections. [3]

[4] Metabolic/genetic factors: Certain breed predispositions, such as in Bedlington Terriers, Labrador Retrievers, and Shar-Peis, suggest an underlying metabolic or genetic basis for cholelith development in some cases. Factors like abnormal copper or bile acid metabolism may play a role. [4,5]

[5] Other factors: Biliary stasis, gallbladder dysmotility, inflammation, and mucinous hyperplasia can also contribute to the formation of choleliths by promoting the entanglement of calcium bilirubinate and bilirubin polymers. [3]

In summary, choleliths in small animals can arise from a variety of infectious, metabolic, and structural causes that lead to bile stasis and stone formation within the biliary tract.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Cats with cholelithiasis can display a range of clinical symptoms and signs, but many cases are asymptomatic.[1] The most common clinical signs associated with symptomatic cholelithiasis include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, lethargy, anorexia, and jaundice.[1] 

Diagnostic imaging such as abdominal ultrasound can reveal additional findings consistent with cholelithiasis, including increased thickness or echogenicity of the biliary tract walls, dilatation of the gallbladder, cystic duct, or common bile duct.[1] Biochemical evidence of biliary disease, such as increased blood bilirubin concentration or liver enzyme activities, may also be present.[1]

In cases where cholelithiasis is an incidental finding and not the primary cause of the clinical signs, other concurrent diseases may be identified, such as cholangitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or chronic enteropathy.[1] Overall, the clinical presentation can be variable, and cholelithiasis may be asymptomatic in some cats.

## Diagnostic Methods

Cholelithiasis can be detected using a variety of diagnostic techniques. Ultrasonography (US) is considered the gold standard, as it can identify choleliths as hyperechoic structures within the gallbladder or bile ducts.[1] US can also reveal associated abnormalities such as biliary tract wall thickening, dilation, or obstruction. 

Laboratory testing may provide supportive evidence of cholelithiasis. Biochemical markers like increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activities can indicate cholestasis.[1] Bilirubin levels may be elevated in cases of biliary obstruction. However, many cats with cholelithiasis do not show overt hyperbilirubinemia.[1]

For animals with suspected small duct cholelithiasis, liver biopsy and culture are often necessary to identify underlying disease processes and associated bacterial infections.[2] Exploratory surgery may also be required in some cases to fully characterize the extent and location of choleliths.

## Treatment Options

Medical management can be an effective option for managing cholelithiasis in dogs. Dogs with incidental cholelithiasis and no signs of extrahepatic biliary obstruction (EHBO) or gallbladder rupture may be candidates for medical treatment [1,2]. The synthetic bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been used to help dissolve choleliths and reduce inflammation in the gallbladder [7-9]. In this study, 4 out of 8 medically treated dogs had complete resolution of cholelithiasis on follow-up ultrasound [2]. 

However, dogs with symptomatic cholelithiasis, EHBO, or gallbladder rupture generally require surgical intervention. Cholecystectomy was performed in 10 dogs, with additional procedures like choledochotomy and duodenotomy in some cases [2]. Surgical management carries a higher risk of short-term mortality compared to medical treatment, but has a good long-term prognosis if the dog survives the perioperative period [4,5].

Overall, the decision between medical or surgical management depends on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and location of choleliths. Asymptomatic dogs without EHBO may be candidates for a trial of UDCA, while dogs with clinical signs, EHBO, or gallbladder rupture often require prompt surgical intervention. Careful monitoring is warranted in all cases to watch for progression or complications. [1-3]

## Preventive Measures

To reduce the risk or recurrence of choleliths in dogs and cats, several key preventive strategies can be employed:

1. **Dietary Management**: Maintain a high-protein, low-fat diet to help prevent bile sludge and stone formation. Supplement with ursodeoxycholic acid, a choleretic that can help dissolve existing stones and prevent new ones.

2. **Environmental Control**: Minimize exposure to environmental toxins in water, air, and from flea/tick/deworming medications, as these can contribute to bile sludging and stone development. [1]

3. **Monitoring and Early Detection**: Regular veterinary checkups, including abdominal ultrasounds, can help detect gallstones early before they cause complications. Promptly address any signs of gallbladder inflammation or infection.

4. **Surgical Intervention**: For cases where choleliths are associated with cholecystitis, obstructing the cystic duct or common bile duct, surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) may be necessary. [1]

5. **Supportive Care**: In some cases, medical management with antibiotics, ursodeoxycholic acid, and pain relief may be sufficient to resolve mild gallbladder disease without surgery. [1]

6. **Lifestyle Adjustments**: Maintain a healthy weight, as obesity is a risk factor for gallstone formation. Manage concurrent conditions like Cushing's disease or hypothyroidism that can predispose to gallbladder problems.

By implementing these preventive measures, pet owners can help reduce the risk of gallstone development and associated complications in their dogs and cats.

## Differential Diagnosis

Cholelithiasis can present with similar clinical signs as other abdominal diseases, such as pancreatitis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, abdominal neoplasia, and other hepatic diseases [1]. Therefore, it is important to differentiate cholelithiasis from these other potential causes.

Laboratory tests may reveal elevated liver enzymes (ALP, GGT, ALT, AST) and bilirubin, which could indicate cholestasis or biliary obstruction [1,2]. However, many animals with cholelithiasis may not be hyperbilirubinemic, as jaundice is only directly related to cholelithiasis when there is extrahepatic bile duct obstruction or sepsis [2].

Imaging plays a key role in diagnosis. Abdominal radiographs may detect radiopaque choleliths, although many stones lack sufficient mineral content to be visible [1,2]. Abdominal ultrasound is the gold standard, allowing visualization of stones within the gallbladder or bile ducts [2]. Ultrasonography can also detect biliary tract dilation, gallbladder wall thickening, and other changes associated with cholelithiasis [1].

In cases of small duct cholelithiasis, liver biopsy and culture may be necessary to identify underlying disease processes and associated bacterial infections that could be predisposing factors [2]. 

Overall, a combination of clinical signs, laboratory findings, and advanced imaging techniques are required to differentiate cholelithiasis from other abdominal disorders with similar presentations.

# Pet Disease: Choleliths

Choleliths, or gallstones, are an uncommon but clinically relevant condition in companion animals. This report explores the epidemiology, causative agents, diagnostic approaches, and treatment options for choleliths in dogs and cats. Key findings include the higher prevalence of cholelithiasis in cats compared to dogs, the role of bacterial infections and metabolic factors in stone formation, and the utility of medical management alongside surgical intervention for symptomatic cases. By understanding this disease, veterinary professionals can provide more effective care for affected pets.

## Conclusion

Cholelithiasis in dogs and cats is a complex condition that requires a multifaceted approach to management. Factors like bacterial infections, metabolic abnormalities, and structural biliary tract defects can all contribute to stone formation. While many cases are asymptomatic, choleliths can lead to serious complications like biliary tract obstruction and cholangitis. 

Diagnostic techniques like abdominal ultrasound and laboratory testing are crucial for identifying the presence and underlying causes of cholelithiasis. Treatment options range from medical management with ursodeoxycholic acid to surgical cholecystectomy, depending on the clinical presentation and location of the stones.

To prevent cholelithiasis, key strategies include dietary modifications, environmental control, early detection through routine monitoring, and prompt treatment of any concurrent biliary or hepatic diseases. By implementing these preventive measures, veterinary teams can help minimize the risk and recurrence of choleliths in companion animals.
