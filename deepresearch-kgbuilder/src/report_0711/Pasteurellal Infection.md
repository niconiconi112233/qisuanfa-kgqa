## Disease Overview

Pasteurella are a genus of gram-negative bacteria that commonly inhabit the oral cavities of many domestic animals, particularly cats and dogs. The most clinically relevant species is Pasteurella multocida, which can cause infections in humans following animal bites, scratches, or exposure to animal saliva. [1] 

Pasteurella infections typically manifest as localized skin and soft tissue infections, such as cellulitis, at the site of an animal-related injury. However, more serious invasive infections like pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, and endocarditis can also occur, especially in immunocompromised individuals. [1,3]

Pasteurella species are considered highly pathogenic due to various virulence factors, including a polysaccharide capsule that aids in immune evasion. Transmission to humans usually occurs through direct inoculation of the bacteria into the skin, such as from an animal bite or scratch. Pasteurella can also be transmitted via contact with infected animal saliva or nasal secretions. [1,3]

Overall, Pasteurella infections are relatively common, with up to 75% of cat bites and 50% of dog bites associated with Pasteurella bacteria. Prompt recognition and appropriate antibiotic treatment are essential, as Pasteurella infections can progress rapidly and lead to significant morbidity if left untreated. [1,2]

## Common Pathogens

Pasteurella, a genus of bacteria, is a common cause of infection in companion animals. The key pathogens include:

[1] Pasteurella multocida, a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic bacterium that is a common commensal in the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract of cats. It is a frequent cause of infected bite wounds, subcutaneous abscesses, and respiratory tract infections in cats. [2,3]

[2] Pasteurella canis, a strain found in the normal flora of dogs that can cause soft tissue infections in humans. [4]

[3] Pasteurella dagmatis, another species that is part of the normal flora in animals like dogs, but can lead to severe infections in humans. [4]

[4] Pasteurella haemolytica, which causes respiratory infections in cattle and horses. [4]

[5] Pasteurella pneumotropica, a strain that can cause disease and death in rodents. [4]

These Pasteurella species are commonly transmitted through animal bites, scratches, or close contact, and can result in a range of clinical manifestations from mild local infections to severe systemic disease, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Prompt recognition and appropriate antibiotic treatment are crucial for managing Pasteurella infections in both animals and humans. [1-4]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Pasteurella multocida infection typically produces acute clinical signs that develop within 1 to 3 days after exposure. The most common symptoms include [1]:

- Fever 
- Hypersalivation
- Nasal discharge
- Difficult respiration

These symptoms are often accompanied by localized cellulitis, abscess formation, and lymphadenopathy at the site of the bite or scratch wound [2,3]. In severe cases, the infection can progress to necrotizing fasciitis, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis [4].

Respiratory infections like pneumonia can also occur, especially in immunocompromised individuals or those with underlying lung disease [5]. More invasive infections such as bacteremia, meningitis, and endocarditis are less common but can be life-threatening [6].

Overall, the rapid onset of clinical signs and symptoms, along with a history of animal contact, should raise suspicion for Pasteurella multocida infection. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent serious complications.

## Diagnostic Methods

Pasteurellosis is typically diagnosed through a combination of clinical evaluation, microbiological testing, and imaging studies.

The most common diagnostic approach involves collecting samples from the affected site, such as wound cultures, respiratory specimens, or body fluids, and sending them for microbiological analysis. Pasteurella species can be identified through culture on specialized media, such as 5% sheep's blood agar, as well as biochemical testing or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry [1,2].

Imaging studies can also play an important role in the diagnosis of pasteurellosis. Radiographs may be used to evaluate for underlying bone or joint involvement, such as osteomyelitis or septic arthritis [1]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide additional detail on soft tissue or bone infections [1].

In cases of suspected invasive or systemic infection, blood cultures may be obtained to identify bacteremia. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis can help diagnose central nervous system involvement, such as meningitis [1,2].

Overall, a combination of clinical history, microbiological testing, and imaging studies is typically required to make a definitive diagnosis of pasteurellosis and guide appropriate treatment. Prompt diagnosis and initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy is crucial, as pasteurellosis can rapidly progress to serious, life-threatening infections if left untreated [1,2].

## Treatment Options

Pasteurella infections are typically treated with antibiotics. The first-line antibiotic options are:

[1] Penicillins and potentiated beta-lactams, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate. These are considered the first-line treatments for Pasteurella infections. [1]

[2] Alternative antibiotic options with proven activity against Pasteurella include doxycycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. These may be used in combination with an anti-anaerobic agent like metronidazole or clindamycin. [1,5]

For more severe systemic infections like bacteremia, meningitis, or endocarditis, parenteral antibiotic regimens are often required. First-line options include ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, or a carbapenem antibiotic. Ceftriaxone or a fluoroquinolone plus an anti-anaerobic agent can also be used. [5]

Antibiotic treatment should be tailored based on culture and sensitivity results when available. Antibiotics with poor Pasteurella activity, such as cephalexin, dicloxacillin, and erythromycin, should be avoided. [15]

In addition to antibiotic therapy, management may also involve surgical intervention for certain complicated infections, such as abscesses, osteomyelitis, or septic arthritis. Prompt wound care, including debridement, is also important. [16]

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is a key strategy for preventing pasteurellal infections. Two vaccine candidates show promise:

[1] The attenuated strain PmCQ2Δ4555-4580 has significantly reduced virulence, with the LD50 increased by approximately 2.8 × 10^9 times compared to the wild-type strain PmCQ2 [2]. This strain provides 100% protection against Pasteurella multocida (Pm) serotypes A and B, and 40% protection against serotype F in mice [2]. The reduced virulence is likely due to deletion of six genes involved in capsule production, LPS biosynthesis, and outer membrane proteins - key virulence factors for Pm [2].

[2] Immunization with purified recombinant proteins from PmCQ2Δ4555-4580 also conferred significant protection against Pm infection in mice. Four proteins (PmCQ2_008205, PmCQ2_010435, PmCQ2_008190, and PmCQ2_004170) in particular provided 50%, 40%, 30%, and 30% protection against Pm serotype A, respectively, and 62.5%, 42.9%, 37.5%, and 28.6% protection against serotype B [2].

These results demonstrate the potential of both live-attenuated and subunit vaccine approaches for preventing pasteurellal infections across multiple Pm serotypes. Further development and testing of these vaccine candidates is warranted.

## Differential Diagnosis

When diagnosing a pasteurellal infection, other diseases with similar symptoms must be considered and ruled out. These include:

[1] Abdominal abscess - Pasteurella infections can present with abscess formation, which must be differentiated from other types of abdominal abscesses. [2]

[2] Acute pyelonephritis - Pasteurella infections can cause sepsis which may initially present as a urinary tract infection. Acute pyelonephritis should be considered in the differential. [3]

[3] Amebic liver/hepatic abscesses - Like Pasteurella, these can cause abdominal pain and fever, and should be ruled out. [4]

[4] Animal bites in emergency medicine - Bite wounds are the most common route of Pasteurella transmission, so bite-related infections must be part of the differential. [5]

[5] Bacterial pneumonia - Pasteurella can cause pneumonia, which must be differentiated from other bacterial causes of pneumonia. [6]

[6] Brain abscess - Central nervous system infections, including brain abscesses, can occur with disseminated Pasteurella infection. [7]

[7] Cat scratch disease - Cat scratches can introduce Pasteurella, so this zoonotic infection should be considered. [8]

[8] Cellulitis - Localized Pasteurella soft tissue infections can present as cellulitis. [9]

[9] Community-acquired pneumonia - Pasteurella pneumonia must be distinguished from other common causes of community-acquired pneumonia. [10]

[10] HACEK group infections - This group of fastidious gram-negative bacteria includes some Pasteurella species. [11]

[11] Haemophilus influenzae infections - Pasteurella and Haemophilus are related genera that can both cause respiratory infections. [12]
