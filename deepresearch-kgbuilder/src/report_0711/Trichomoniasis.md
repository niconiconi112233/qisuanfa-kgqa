## Disease Overview

Trichomoniasis is a common infection in small animals, mostly manifesting in gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea. The causative agent is the flagellated protozoan parasite _Tritrichomonas blagburni_ in cats and _Pentatrichomonas hominis_ in dogs [1,2]. 

While many infected cats remain asymptomatic, the most common clinical sign is chronic diarrhea, which can last for weeks, months or years [1]. Diarrhea may contain blood and/or mucus and is often accompanied by large bowel inflammation and fecal incontinence [1]. Trichomoniasis is most common in cats housed in catteries, where up to 31% of cats and 28% of catteries have been found positive [1,3]. 

The parasite lives in the host's descending colon and cecum, dividing by binary fission, and can form pseudocysts under adverse conditions, though there is no resistant cyst stage that can survive outside the host [1]. Transmission occurs primarily through the fecal-oral route, though mechanical transmission via contaminated fomites is also possible [1].

## Common Pathogens

Trichomoniasis in pets is caused by several species of protozoan parasites. The primary pathogens are:

[1] *Tritrichomonas blagburni* (formerly known as *Tritrichomonas foetus*): This is the most prevalent pathogen causing trichomoniasis in cats. It primarily infects the large intestine and can lead to chronic, intermittent diarrhea. [2,3,4]

[2] *Pentatrichomonas hominis*: This parasite is less common in cats compared to dogs, but can also cause diarrhea. Its clinical significance in cats is still debated. [9,10]

Additionally, other trichomonad species like *Trichomonas tenax* can sometimes be found in the oral cavities of dogs and cats, but are not associated with clinical disease. [5,6,30]

Importantly, the feline isolate of *T. blagburni* is distinct from the bovine isolate, which causes a sexually transmitted disease in cattle. The feline and bovine isolates show minor genetic differences and vary in their pathogenicity. [16-20]

Overall, *T. blagburni* is the primary cause of trichomoniasis and chronic diarrhea in cats, while *P. hominis* is more common in dogs. Careful differentiation between these species is required for accurate diagnosis and treatment. [9,10]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

The hallmark symptom of tritrichomoniasis in cats is chronic, foul-smelling diarrhea. Affected cats may experience soft, watery stools with mucus or blood.[1] Some cats may also exhibit signs of rectal itching or irritation, such as scooting or licking of the perineal area.[2] Chronic diarrhea and gastrointestinal discomfort can lead to weight loss and poor body condition in affected cats.[3]

## Diagnostic Methods

Tritrichomonas blagburni, the causative agent of trichomoniasis in cats, can be challenging to diagnose due to its similarity to other protozoa and the intermittent shedding of the organism in feces [1]. However, there are several diagnostic methods available to veterinarians.

The first step is a thorough physical examination and review of the cat's clinical signs, such as chronic, watery diarrhea with an unpleasant odor. The veterinarian may then recommend laboratory testing, which can include:

1. Fecal culture: This can increase the number of detectable organisms, making diagnosis more likely [1]. However, the culture process can be time-consuming and may not be available in all diagnostic laboratories.

2. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing: PCR is considered the most sensitive and specific diagnostic method for T. blagburni [2]. It can detect the parasite's DNA even when the organism is present in low numbers or being shed intermittently.

3. Fecal smear examination: While less sensitive than PCR, a microscopic examination of a fresh fecal sample may reveal the characteristic pear-shaped trophozoites of T. blagburni [1].

In some cases, additional diagnostics such as bloodwork, imaging, or even a biopsy may be necessary to rule out other potential causes of chronic diarrhea and to confirm the T. blagburni diagnosis [3].

Overall, a combination of clinical signs, fecal culture, PCR testing, and potentially other diagnostic modalities may be required to accurately diagnose trichomoniasis in cats.

## Treatment Options

Cats with trichomoniasis often require specific medication for effective treatment. The antiprotozoal drug ronidazole has been shown to be the most effective treatment option, but it must be used with caution as it can have side effects [1]. Other medications like tinidazole or metronidazole have also been used with varying success [2].

In addition to medication, supportive care is important to manage the diarrhea and keep the cat healthy during the infection. Dietary changes to high-fiber foods and probiotics may help improve stool consistency [3]. Good hygiene practices like daily litter box cleaning and disinfection are also crucial to control the spread of infection to other cats in the household [3].

For some cats with only mild or intermittent symptoms, the diarrhea may resolve on its own over time, though the cat will remain a carrier of the parasite [3]. However, persistent infection can occur in about 25% of cats despite treatment, requiring additional rounds of medication [3].

## Preventive Measures

Trichomoniasis, caused by the protozoan parasite Tritrichomonas blagburni, is a common infection in cats, especially young cats and those housed in multi-cat environments like catteries. To prevent the spread of this disease, several key measures can be taken:

Maintain a clean environment. Scoop litter boxes daily and thoroughly disinfect them regularly. This helps remove any contaminated feces and reduces the risk of transmission between cats.[1,2] 

Minimize stress for cats where possible. Provide plenty of individual resting spaces and opportunities for exercise to reduce stress, which can exacerbate symptoms and prolong infections.[2]

Test all cats in a household if one is diagnosed. Since some cats may be asymptomatic carriers, testing all feline housemates can help identify and isolate infected animals to prevent further spread.[3,4]

Maintain good hygiene practices. Wear disposable gloves when cleaning litter boxes and wash hands thoroughly afterwards. This reduces the risk of human exposure, as trichomoniasis can rarely infect immunocompromised people.[5]

By implementing these preventive measures, the risk of trichomoniasis transmission in multi-cat environments can be significantly reduced.

## Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for trichomoniasis in pets should include other diseases with similar symptoms, such as campylobacteriosis, leptospirosis, brucellosis, neosporosis, chlamydiosis, bovine viral diarrhea, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, and anaplasmosis [1]. These diseases can also cause infertility, vaginitis, pyometra, abortions, and vaginal discharge in affected animals.

To differentiate trichomoniasis from these other conditions, microscopic examination of a wet mount or culture of samples (preputial smegma, vaginal mucus, aborted fetal tissues) to detect the motile Tritrichomonas foetus parasite is required [1]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing can also be used to specifically identify the T. foetus organism [1].

# Pet Disease: Trichomoniasis

Trichomoniasis is a common infection in companion animals, primarily affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Caused by protozoan parasites like Tritrichomonas blagburni in cats and Pentatrichomonas hominis in dogs, this disease often manifests as chronic, foul-smelling diarrhea. Accurate diagnosis through techniques like PCR testing is crucial, as treatment with antiprotozoal drugs like ronidazole can effectively manage the infection. To prevent the spread of trichomoniasis, maintaining a clean environment, minimizing stress, and practicing good hygiene are key. Understanding the clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, and preventive measures is essential for veterinary professionals to effectively manage this challenging parasitic disease.

## Conclusion

Trichomoniasis is a significant concern in companion animal practice, requiring a multifaceted approach for effective management. Accurate diagnosis through advanced techniques like PCR, coupled with targeted antiprotozoal treatment and supportive care, can help resolve the chronic diarrhea associated with this disease. Importantly, preventing the spread of trichomoniasis through environmental hygiene and multi-cat household testing is crucial to control this persistent infection. By synthesizing the insights from this report, veterinary teams can provide comprehensive care and improve the quality of life for pets affected by trichomoniasis.
