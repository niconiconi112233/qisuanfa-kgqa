## Disease Overview

Chronic pancreatitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the pancreas characterized by permanent changes, mainly fibrosis or atrophy and adhesions.[1] It is increasingly being recognized in both dogs and cats, and is defined by the presence of both fibrosis and active, generally lymphoplasmacytic, inflammation.[2,3] 

The exact etiology of chronic pancreatitis is often unknown, but several risk factors have been identified, including breed predispositions, hyperlipidemia, and certain medications.[1,3] Chronic pancreatitis may occur following episodes of acute pancreatitis, or it can develop concurrently with other inflammatory conditions of the abdomen, such as inflammatory bowel disease or cholangiohepatitis.[1,3]

Clinically, chronic pancreatitis can range from mild, nonspecific gastrointestinal signs to more severe disease with vomiting, abdominal pain, and weight loss.[1,3] However, the clinical signs are often vague and nonspecific, making diagnosis challenging. Diagnostic tests like the serum pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (Spec cPL/fPL) assay can be helpful, but the sensitivity is relatively low for chronic disease.[3] Pancreatic biopsy may be required to confirm the diagnosis in some cases.

## Common Pathogens

There is limited information on the specific causes of chronic pancreatitis in pets. Most cases are considered idiopathic, without an identifiable underlying cause [1]. However, some potential viral, bacterial, and other pathogens have been associated with pancreatitis in dogs and cats:

Viral infections: Feline coronavirus, parvovirus, herpesvirus, and calicivirus have been reported as rare causes of pancreatitis in cats [6,8,9,10]. 

Bacterial infections: Certain parasites like Toxoplasma gondii, Eurytrema procyonis, and Amphimerus pseudofelineus have been linked to pancreatitis in cats [6,8,9].

Other causes: Pancreatic trauma from injuries like road accidents or falls can lead to pancreatitis [14]. Organophosphate exposure has also been associated with pancreatitis in a few case reports [15].

However, the evidence for a clear cause-and-effect relationship between these infectious agents or other factors and the development of chronic pancreatitis is generally weak. In the majority of cases, the underlying cause remains unknown [1].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

The clinical signs associated with chronic pancreatitis in dogs and cats can be quite variable. In dogs, the most common symptoms include anorexia (91%), vomiting (90%), weakness (79%), and abdominal pain (58%) [1]. However, these findings may not reflect the typical presentation seen in a veterinary practice, as the cited study focused on the most severely affected patients.

In cats, the clinical signs tend to be even more vague, with anorexia (87%), lethargy (81%), dehydration (54%), and weight loss (47%) being most commonly reported [1]. Vomiting is only seen in about 46% of affected cats. Abdominal pain is infrequently recognized in both dogs and cats with pancreatitis, likely due to difficulty in assessing pain in these species [1].

It is important to note that many dogs and cats with milder forms of pancreatitis may be subclinical or have only subtle clinical signs such as decreased appetite or diarrhea [1]. Overall, the presentation can be quite variable, and a high index of suspicion is required to diagnose pancreatitis, especially in the early stages of the disease.

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosing chronic pancreatitis can be challenging, as the clinical signs are often nonspecific and mild. The gold standard for diagnosis is histological examination of the pancreas, but this is rarely performed in dogs and cats due to the risks involved. [1] Instead, clinicians must rely on a combination of clinical signs, laboratory tests, and imaging.

Measurement of serum pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (PLI) is considered the most specific and sensitive diagnostic test for pancreatitis in dogs and cats. The Spec cPL and Spec fPL tests are commercially available assays that can confirm the presence of pancreatitis. [2,3] A positive test suggests pancreatitis, though a negative result does not completely rule it out.

Abdominal ultrasound can be useful, but the sensitivity is highly dependent on the operator's experience. Findings such as pancreatic enlargement, decreased echogenicity, and peripancreatic fluid accumulation may indicate pancreatitis, but normal ultrasound findings do not exclude the condition. [3] More advanced imaging techniques like CT and MRI are not routinely used for diagnosis.

In some cases, the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis remains presumptive, based on the patient's clinical history, response to dietary and medical management, and exclusion of other differential diagnoses. Regular monitoring of serum PLI levels can help track the progression of the disease.

## Treatment Options

Pancreatitis in cats is a complex condition that requires a multifaceted approach to management. The key aspects of treatment include:

[1] Risk reduction: Identifying and addressing potential risk factors such as dietary indiscretion, infections, hypercalcemia, and medications. Switching to a lower-fat diet may be beneficial.

[2] Nutritional management: Providing nutritional support is critical. Appetite stimulants like mirtazapine may be used, but tube feeding is often required in anorexic cats. A highly digestible, moderate-fat diet is recommended. 

[3] Symptomatic therapy: Anti-nausea medications (e.g. maropitant, ondansetron), pain relief (e.g. buprenorphine, butorphanol), and antibiotics (if concurrent infection) are commonly used.

[4] Concurrent condition management: Conditions like cholangitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and diabetes mellitus often occur concurrently and must be properly diagnosed and treated.

[5] Immunosuppressive therapy: In some cases, prednisolone or cyclosporine may be beneficial in managing an immune-mediated component to the pancreatitis.

[6] Monitoring: Frequent monitoring of the cat's clinical status, pancreatic lipase levels, and any developing complications is essential for guiding therapy and assessing response.

Overall, the successful management of feline chronic pancreatitis requires a comprehensive, multimodal approach tailored to the individual patient's needs and underlying conditions. Close veterinary supervision is critical for these complex cases.

## Preventive Measures

The key preventive measures to avoid chronic pancreatitis in pets include:

[1] Proper nutrition: Avoid feeding high-fat or greasy foods, as excessive fat consumption is a common trigger for pancreatitis. Stick to a balanced, nutritionally appropriate diet for the pet's age, breed, and health status. Be cautious with table scraps, especially those containing fatty ingredients.

[2] Portion control: Overfeeding can put additional stress on the pancreas. Follow recommended portion sizes based on the pet's age, weight, and activity level. Treats and food toppers should not exceed 10% of the pet's daily intake.

[3] Regular exercise: Maintaining a healthy weight and providing regular exercise can help reduce the risk of excess weight, a known predisposing factor for pancreatitis. Regular walks, dog parks, swimming, and enrichment activities are excellent ways to keep pets active.

[4] Regular veterinary checkups: Scheduling regular wellness exams can help detect pancreatitis early, when the prognosis is better. Veterinarians can evaluate the pet's diet and lifestyle, and make recommendations to prevent pancreatitis and ensure overall health.

[5] Vaccination and isolation: In some cases, infectious diseases like Toxoplasma gondii or feline infectious peritonitis have been associated with pancreatitis. Keeping pets up-to-date on vaccinations and isolating them from potential infectious agents may help prevent pancreatitis.

[6] Environmental management: Reducing exposure to environmental toxins, medications, or other potential triggers that may contribute to pancreatitis is also important for prevention.

By implementing these comprehensive preventive measures, pet owners can help reduce the risk of chronic pancreatitis in their dogs and cats.

## Differential Diagnosis

Chronic pancreatitis can be challenging to diagnose as it often presents with mild, non-specific clinical signs that overlap with other gastrointestinal diseases. When evaluating a patient for potential chronic pancreatitis, it is important to consider the following differential diagnoses:

[1] Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Like chronic pancreatitis, IBD can cause symptoms such as anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss. Concurrent IBD is also common in patients with chronic pancreatitis. [2]

[2] Hepatic disease: Inflammation of the liver, such as chronic hepatitis, can lead to similar clinical signs as chronic pancreatitis. Elevated liver enzymes may be observed in both conditions. [2,3]

[3] Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI): Damage to the pancreas from chronic inflammation can impair exocrine pancreatic function, leading to EPI. Patients with EPI often present with weight loss, diarrhea, and polyphagia. [2,8]

[4] Diabetes mellitus: Chronic pancreatitis can sometimes cause destruction of the endocrine pancreas, leading to development of diabetes mellitus. Polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss may be seen in both conditions. [2,8]

[5] Neoplasia: Both pancreatic adenocarcinoma and pancreatic duct obstruction by other abdominal masses can cause pancreatitis, acute or chronic. [3,35,36]

[6] Triaditis: The coexistence of pancreatitis, cholangiohepatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease is well-recognized in cats, and can make diagnosis and management challenging. [6,31,34]

Careful history-taking, physical examination, and diagnostic testing (e.g. serum pancreatic lipase, abdominal imaging) are crucial to differentiate chronic pancreatitis from these other potential causes of gastrointestinal disease. A comprehensive workup is often needed to arrive at the correct diagnosis.
