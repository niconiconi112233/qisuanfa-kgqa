## Disease Overview

Cholecystitis, or inflammation of the gallbladder, is an uncommon but important condition in companion animals. While cholelithiasis (gallstones) are often an incidental finding, they can also lead to symptomatic cholecystitis in some cases. 

The prevalence of cholelithiasis in cats has been reported as around 1% in one large retrospective study. Cats with cholelithiasis can be asymptomatic or develop clinical signs related to cholecystitis, biliary tract obstruction, or concurrent hepatobiliary disease. 

Cholelithiasis is more commonly an incidental finding in cats, with up to 41% of cases classified as asymptomatic. However, the remaining 59% of cats develop symptomatic cholecystitis, often in association with other hepatobiliary disorders. Factors like the location and number of choleliths, as well as the presence of biliary tract obstruction, appear to increase the risk of cats developing clinical signs.

Overall, cholecystitis secondary to cholelithiasis is an uncommon but important condition in cats that requires careful diagnostic evaluation and appropriate management to avoid complications like gallbladder rupture and bile peritonitis. Monitoring for and managing concurrent hepatobiliary diseases is also crucial in these patients.

## Common Pathogens

Cholecystitis, or inflammation of the gallbladder, can have various underlying causes in dogs and cats, including both viral and bacterial infections [1,2,3]. Bacterial pathogens commonly isolated from cases of cholecystitis include enteric organisms such as _Escherichia coli_, _Enterococcus_ spp., _Bacteroides_ spp., and _Clostridium_ spp. [2,4,5,6,7]. These bacteria may ascend through the common bile duct from the intestinal tract or reach the gallbladder through the bloodstream via the enterohepatic circulation [2,7]. 

Gas-producing bacteria like _E. coli_ and _Clostridium_ spp. can also cause emphysematous cholecystitis, which is recognized most frequently in diabetic dogs [2]. Cholelithiasis or biliary sludge can predispose to cholecystitis by obstructing the cystic duct, leading to gallbladder distension, stasis, and proliferation of anaerobic organisms [2].

In addition to bacterial causes, _Campylobacter jejuni_ bacteremia has been documented as a cause of acute cholecystitis in dogs, although the gastrointestinal tract was suspected as the source rather than diarrhea [2]. Viral infections, such as canine infectious hepatitis, can also lead to acute cholecystitis characterized by edema and hemorrhage in the gallbladder [8].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Cholecystitis in small animals can present with a variety of clinical symptoms and signs. The typical clinical presentation includes:

- Abdominal pain, which may be only postprandial 
- Fever
- Vomiting
- Ileus
- Mild to moderate jaundice

Some animals also develop endotoxic shock with cholecystitis. The hemogram often shows variable leukocytosis, with or without toxic neutrophils or a left shift. 

Hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice depend on the chronicity of the condition, involvement of extrahepatic biliary structures, presence or extent of biliary tree obstruction, bile peritonitis, and endotoxemia. Liver enzyme activities are variable, but alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) are usually moderately to markedly increased.

Gallbladder rupture can lead to pericholecystic abscess formation or focal/generalized bile peritonitis. Abdominal radiography may reveal indistinct detail in the cranial abdomen consistent with focal peritonitis. Ultrasonographic detection of a thickened gallbladder wall or cystic bile duct, and tenderness during the imaging procedure or on deep abdominal palpation, may be the only evidence of illness in some cases.

## Diagnostic Methods

Examination of clinical presentation, laboratory testing, and imaging techniques used to diagnose cholecystitis.

Clinical signs of acute cholecystitis include abdominal pain (may only be postprandial), fever, vomiting, ileus, and mild to moderate jaundice. Some animals develop endotoxic shock. The hemogram may show variable leukocytosis, with or without toxic neutrophils or a left shift. 

Hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice depend on the chronicity, involvement of extrahepatic biliary structures, presence or extent of biliary tree occlusion, bile peritonitis, and endotoxemia. Liver enzyme activity is variable, but alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) are usually moderately to markedly increased.

Gallbladder rupture leads to pericholecystic abscess formation or bile peritonitis. Abdominal radiography may reveal indistinct detail in the cranial abdomen consistent with focal peritonitis, and a sentinel intestinal loop may implicate focal ileus. Rarely, the gallbladder wall may become radiodense due to dystrophic mineralization.

Ultrasonographic detection of a thickened gallbladder wall or cystic bile duct and tenderness during the imaging procedure or on deep abdominal palpation may be the only evidence of illness. Choleliths may be found on ultrasonography. Detection of gas within the biliary tree or gallbladder heralds an emphysematous process associated with sepsis.

Comparison of total bilirubin concentration in effusion versus serum helps confirm bile leakage. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs, clinicopathologic features, and ultrasonographic imaging.

## Treatment Options

Cholecystitis, an inflammation of the gallbladder, is typically managed through a combination of medical and surgical approaches. The key treatment options include:

[1] Fluid and electrolyte restoration: Providing intravenous fluids, such as Ringer's lactate, helps correct any fluid and electrolyte imbalances caused by the condition. [1]

[2] Antibiotic therapy: Broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as a combination of ceftriaxone/tazobactum and metronidazole, are used to treat any underlying bacterial infection. The antibiotic choice is often guided by culture and sensitivity testing of the bile. [1,2]

[3] Choleretic therapy: Medications like ursodeoxycholic acid can help improve bile flow and reduce inflammation in the gallbladder. [1]

[4] Antioxidant supplementation: Silymarin, a milk thistle extract, has been used to support liver function. [1]

[5] Surgical intervention: In severe cases, or when medical management fails, cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) is the recommended treatment. This is often required in cases of gallbladder rupture, bile peritonitis, or extrahepatic bile duct obstruction. [1,2,3,4]

Careful monitoring and long-term antibiotic treatment may be necessary in some cases, especially if the common bile duct or other biliary structures are involved. The prognosis is generally good for dogs with cholecystitis, provided there are no major complications like gallbladder rupture or sepsis. [1,4]

## Preventive Measures

Cholecystitis, or inflammation of the gallbladder, can have various underlying causes in dogs and cats, including bacterial infection, bile duct obstruction, and gallbladder mucocele formation. Preventive measures to reduce the risk of cholecystitis include:

[1] Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet. A diet focused on high-quality, lean proteins and easily digestible foods can support proper gallbladder and liver function. Avoid foods high in fat, sugar, and refined grains, which can exacerbate gallbladder issues.

[2] Ensuring your pet maintains an ideal body weight. Obesity is a risk factor for gallbladder disease, so keeping your dog or cat at a healthy weight through diet and exercise is important.

[3] Minimizing exposure to environmental toxins and unnecessary medications. Toxins and certain drugs can disrupt the gut microbiome, which is crucial for proper gallbladder and liver function. Use natural and holistic approaches when possible.

[4] Considering supplementation with digestive enzymes, milk thistle, SAMe, and other natural remedies. These can help support liver and gallbladder health.

[5] Monitoring for signs of gallbladder or liver disease, such as abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and jaundice, and seeking prompt veterinary care if concerns arise.

[6] For breeds predisposed to gallbladder issues, such as Shetland Sheepdogs, considering prophylactic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) to prevent complications from gallbladder mucocele formation.

By implementing these preventive measures, you can help reduce the risk of cholecystitis and other gallbladder disorders in your pet.

## Differential Diagnosis

Cholecystitis, or inflammation of the gallbladder, can have similar symptoms to other digestive diseases in cats. When evaluating a cat with potential gallbladder or bile duct issues, the veterinarian should consider the following differential diagnoses:

[1] Acute neutrophilic cholangitis: This condition involves inflammation of the bile ducts and is associated with Salmonella infections in cats.[1] The clinical signs can overlap with cholecystitis.

[2] Extrahepatic bile duct obstruction (EHBDO): Bile duct obstruction from causes like bile sludge, choleliths, pancreatitis, or tumors can lead to cholestasis and similar symptoms as cholecystitis.[2] Differentiating the underlying cause is important for appropriate treatment.

[3] Cholangitis: Inflammation of the bile ducts, which can occur in isolation or as part of the cholangiohepatitis syndrome. This may have similar clinical presentations to cholecystitis.[2]

[4] Hepatic lipidosis: Also known as fatty liver disease, this metabolic disorder can cause lethargy, decreased appetite, and jaundice, overlapping with gallbladder/bile duct disease.[3]

In summary, the veterinarian must consider conditions affecting the biliary system, liver, and pancreas when evaluating a cat with suspected gallbladder or bile duct disease. Diagnostic tests like bloodwork, imaging, and potentially biopsy are often needed to differentiate the underlying cause.
