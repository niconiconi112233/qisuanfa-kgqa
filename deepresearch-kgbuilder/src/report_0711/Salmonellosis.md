## Disease Overview

Salmonellosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection caused by Salmonella organisms, which can affect both humans and companion animals such as dogs and cats [1]. Non-typhoidal salmonellosis is a significant public health concern, as it can be transmitted from animals to humans [1]. In companion animals, salmonellosis can manifest as acute diarrhea, with or without septicemia, though clinical signs are often mild or subclinical [4].

Epidemiological studies have found varying prevalence rates of Salmonella in companion animals. One study reported a 17.9% prevalence in dogs, with the highest rates observed in dogs aged 1-3 years [3]. Another study found a 5.73% prevalence in dogs and 0% in cats [5]. Salmonella prevalence and persistence in companion animals are important considerations, as they can serve as a reservoir for the pathogen and potentially transmit it to humans [2].

## Common Pathogens

Salmonellosis in dogs and cats is primarily caused by various species and strains of the Salmonella enterica bacterium.[1] Dogs and cats can become infected with Salmonella through exposure to contaminated food, water, or environment, as well as through direct contact with infected animals or humans.[2][3] Once infected, the animals can develop acute diarrhea and septicemia (blood infection).[1]

In addition to Salmonella enterica, there are over 2,000 different types or serovars of the Salmonella bacteria that can potentially cause salmonellosis in pets.[2][4] The most common routes of transmission include consumption of raw or undercooked meat, contact with infected feces, and exposure to contaminated environments.[5] Proper hygiene, food handling, and prevention of contact with infected animals or their waste can help reduce the risk of salmonellosis in dogs and cats.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

The typical clinical presentation of salmonellosis in dogs and cats includes a range of gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms. In dogs, common symptoms are fever, loss of appetite, diarrhea (which may be bloody), abdominal pain, and in some cases, abortion.[1] Cats often exhibit vomiting, diarrhea (including mucus in the stool), abdominal pain, fever, weight loss, lethargy, and decreased or total loss of appetite.[2,3] 

More severe cases can lead to prolonged fever, chronic diarrhea, overall lethargy, and in rare instances, death.[4] Neurological signs and pneumonia have also been reported in some animals.[2] Immediate veterinary attention is required for pets showing symptoms such as fever, blood in the stool, difficulty breathing, or skin lesions.[5,6]

## Diagnostic Methods

The key diagnostic tests for identifying salmonellosis in companion animals are fecal cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. [1] Fecal samples can be analyzed through bacterial culture to isolate and identify the Salmonella pathogen. [3] Additionally, PCR testing provides a rapid and accurate method for detecting the presence of Salmonella DNA in the sample. [4,5] 

Other supporting diagnostics may include bloodwork, radiographs, and additional fecal tests to rule out other potential causes of the animal's symptoms, which can include diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and lethargy. [2] Repeated isolation of the pathogen from fecal samples can also suggest a carrier status in the animal. [3]

Overall, a combination of fecal culture, PCR testing, and other diagnostic procedures can confirm the presence of salmonellosis and guide appropriate treatment and management for affected companion animals. [1,2,3,4,5]

## Treatment Options

The standard medical treatment for salmonellosis in pets typically involves a combination of supportive care and targeted antimicrobial therapy. Intravenous fluid therapy is crucial to maintain proper hydration and blood pressure in affected animals.[1][2] Controlling nausea and vomiting is also an important aspect of the supportive care.[2]

For antibiotic treatment, the recommended drugs are macrolides like erythromycin or quinolones like enrofloxacin.[5] These antimicrobials help eliminate the Salmonella bacteria, although the macrolides are generally preferred.[5] Antimicrobial therapy should be continued for up to 6 days.[4] It's important to note that antibiotics are not always necessary, especially in cats, as the infection may resolve on its own with just supportive care.[1]

Proper nursing care, such as keeping the animal comfortable and monitoring for any complications, is also an integral part of the overall management of salmonellosis in pets.[2][4]

## Preventive Measures

To prevent salmonellosis infections in dogs and cats, vaccination and proper environmental management are crucial. Salmonella vaccines have shown potential for effective immune protection against the disease [1,2,3]. Live vaccines are particularly effective in eliciting both humoral (antibody) and cellular immune responses, which are necessary for optimal protection [3,4]. 

For environmental management, practicing strict biosecurity measures is key. This includes isolating new arrivals for at least two weeks, maintaining good sanitary protocols, and avoiding exposure to sources of Salmonella such as raw meat and infected rodents [6,7,8]. Additionally, pet owners should be aware that even frozen or dried foods can still harbor Salmonella, and take appropriate precautions [9].

## Differential Diagnosis

Salmonellosis in companion animals, such as dogs and cats, can present with similar symptoms as other gastrointestinal diseases. The key differential diagnoses to consider include viral gastroenteritis, parasitic infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and other bacterial infections.[1]

Viral gastroenteritis, caused by pathogens like parvovirus or coronavirus, can also lead to acute diarrhea and vomiting in pets.[1] Parasitic infections, such as giardiasis or coccidiosis, may also produce comparable clinical signs.[1] Inflammatory bowel disease, a chronic condition, can cause intermittent diarrhea and weight loss.[1] Additionally, other bacterial infections, like Clostridium or Escherichia coli, may present with severe diarrhea similar to salmonellosis.[1]

Differentiating salmonellosis from these conditions often requires diagnostic testing, including bacterial culture, fecal examination, and potentially imaging or biopsy studies.[2] A thorough patient history, including any recent dietary changes, travel, or exposure to potential sources of Salmonella, can also help guide the diagnostic process.[4]
