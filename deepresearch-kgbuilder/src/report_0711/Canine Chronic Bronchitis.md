## Disease Overview

Canine chronic bronchitis is a common inflammatory airway disease that primarily affects older, small-breed dogs [1]. It is characterized by a chronic cough that is present most days for at least 2 months [2]. The condition is irreversible and slowly progressive, often leading to permanent changes in the airways [1,4].

Chronic bronchitis may occur in all dog breeds, but appears to be more common in small and toy breeds such as West Highland white terriers and cocker spaniels [1,5]. The exact causes are not well understood, but long-term exposure to airway irritants like tobacco smoke, air pollutants, or allergens may contribute to the development of chronic inflammation [1]. 

Clinical signs include a persistent, dry or harsh cough that may lead to gagging or retching, as well as exercise intolerance and breathing difficulties in advanced cases [1,2]. Diagnosis involves ruling out other potential causes of chronic cough through physical exam, diagnostic imaging, airway sampling, and lung function testing [2,4].

Treatment focuses on reducing airway inflammation with glucocorticoids, and managing symptoms with bronchodilators and cough suppressants as needed [4]. While the condition cannot be cured, appropriate management can help slow disease progression and improve the dog's quality of life [1].

## Common Pathogens

Canine chronic bronchitis does not have a definitive underlying cause, but long-term airway inflammation may result from exposure to inhaled irritants such as tobacco smoke, air pollutants, or allergens [1]. Bacteria associated with dental disease may also contribute to respiratory infections that worsen chronic bronchitis [1]. While no specific infectious agents have been identified as a primary cause, secondary bacterial infections can occur and exacerbate the condition [2,3].

Here is a draft section on the clinical symptoms and signs associated with canine chronic bronchitis:

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Examination of the clinical presentation and symptoms associated with canine chronic bronchitis reveals several key findings:

Chronic cough is the primary and defining symptom of canine chronic bronchitis. The cough is typically described as "deep" or "throaty" in nature, rather than the high-pitched "honking" cough seen with tracheal collapse [1]. The cough often becomes more pronounced when the dog is first waking up, then lessens during the day as the dog becomes more active [2]. 

Many dogs with chronic bronchitis will also exhibit signs of increased mucus production, including gagging, retching, or swallowing after coughing episodes [2]. This is due to the excessive mucus that builds up in the airways as a result of the chronic inflammation.

While some dogs with chronic bronchitis may appear outwardly healthy, others can develop severe exercise intolerance and respiratory distress, especially with exertion [1]. This variability is likely due to the degree of airway collapse and structural damage that has occurred. Dogs with more advanced disease and greater airway compromise will exhibit more pronounced clinical signs.

Physical exam findings in dogs with chronic bronchitis include crackles or wheezes heard on lung auscultation, as well as a sinus arrhythmia, which can be detected by palpating the femoral pulse [1]. The heart rate is typically normal or even slightly slower than expected for the breed.

In summary, the hallmark signs of canine chronic bronchitis are a persistent, productive cough, along with variable degrees of exercise intolerance and respiratory distress, depending on the severity of airway inflammation and structural changes.

## Diagnostic Methods

Canine chronic bronchitis is typically diagnosed based on a history of chronic cough and supportive diagnostic tests. The key diagnostic approaches include:

[1] Chest radiographs: These can reveal thickened bronchial walls and other changes characteristic of chronic bronchitis, though radiographs may appear normal in some cases.

[2] Airway cytology: Samples obtained via tracheal wash, bronchoalveolar lavage, or bronchoscopy often show a predominance of neutrophils, indicating airway inflammation. Eosinophilia may be seen in some cases.

[3] Bronchoscopy: Direct visualization of the airways can reveal erythema, edema, and excessive mucus production typical of chronic bronchitis. Concurrent airway collapse may also be observed.

[4] Lung function testing: Techniques like arterial blood gas analysis, pulse oximetry, and the 6-minute walk test can provide objective measures of lung function and exercise capacity in dogs with chronic bronchitis.

The diagnosis of canine chronic bronchitis is based on integrating the clinical history, physical exam findings, and results of these diagnostic tests, after excluding other potential causes of chronic cough.

## Treatment Options

<b>Corticosteroids</b>
- Glucocorticoids are the most effective treatment for canine chronic bronchitis
- They reduce inflammation and decrease cough and mucus production
- Typical starting dose is prednisone 1 mg/kg twice daily, then tapering to the lowest effective dose

<b>Bronchodilators</b>
- Bronchodilators like theophylline or terbutaline can help dilate the airways
- However, they are only effective in about half of dogs with chronic bronchitis
- They may cause side effects like vomiting, nausea, and lethargy

<b>Antibiotics</b>
- Antibiotics are only warranted if there is evidence of a bacterial infection
- Routine use of antibiotics is not recommended as bacteria are often just colonizing the airways
- Antibiotic selection should be based on culture and sensitivity results

<b>Cough Suppressants</b>
- Cough suppressants like hydrocodone can help control chronic, non-productive cough
- This can improve the dog's quality of life and prevent further airway irritation

<b>Environmental Management</b>
- Avoiding exposures to irritants like smoke, dust, and strong smells can help reduce flare-ups
- Maintaining good oral hygiene through regular teeth brushing and cleanings is also important

## Preventive Measures

Preventing canine chronic bronchitis involves reducing exposure to irritants and maintaining good overall health. Some key preventive measures include:

Environmental management: Minimize exposure to cigarette smoke, dust, aerosols, and other airborne irritants that can trigger or worsen bronchitis symptoms. [1] Ensure good air quality and ventilation in the dog's living space.

Dental care: Maintaining good oral hygiene is important, as dental disease can contribute to respiratory infections. Regular teeth brushing and professional cleanings are recommended. [2]

Weight management: Obesity can worsen respiratory issues, so maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise is beneficial. [1] 

Vaccination: Appropriate vaccination against infectious respiratory diseases like canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) can help prevent secondary infections that can exacerbate chronic bronchitis. [3]

By implementing these preventive measures, the progression of canine chronic bronchitis may be slowed and the dog's overall health and quality of life improved.

## Differential Diagnosis

Canine chronic bronchitis can present with similar symptoms as several other respiratory diseases in dogs. Some key differential diagnoses to consider include:

[1] Pulmonary edema, whether cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic, can cause coughing and respiratory distress. Differentiating chronic bronchitis from heart failure is an important step. [1]

[2] Canine infectious tracheobronchitis, also known as "kennel cough", can lead to persistent coughing. Viral and bacterial agents like Bordetella are common causes. [1]  

[3] Allergic bronchitis or asthma-like conditions may present with chronic cough, especially in certain breeds like terriers and poodles. [1]

[4] Bacterial bronchitis or pneumonia, often caused by common pathogens like E. coli, Klebsiella, or Streptococcus, can result in productive cough. [1]

[5] Parasitic diseases such as lungworm infections can also manifest with coughing in dogs. [1]

[6] Severe fungal pneumonia, including histoplasmosis or blastomycosis, may present with chronic cough. [1]

[7] Tracheal collapse and upper airway dysfunction like laryngeal paralysis can produce coughing that resembles chronic bronchitis. [1]

To accurately diagnose canine chronic bronchitis, it is essential to rule out these other potential causes through a thorough diagnostic workup, including imaging, airway sampling, and potentially advanced testing like bronchoscopy. [1,3]
