## Disease Overview

Cholangitis is an inflammatory condition that primarily affects the bile ducts in companion animals. In cats, neutrophilic cholangitis is more common than in dogs.[1] The proposed pathogenesis is typically secondary to reflux of ascending intestinal bacterial infections.[1,5] Cholangitis can be classified into acute or chronic subtypes, with the acute form often associated with fever, weight loss, and a neutrophilic inflammatory response.[3,6,7] However, there can be overlap in clinical and laboratory findings between acute and chronic disease.[1] 

Diagnosis of cholangitis relies on a combination of clinical signs, laboratory testing, imaging, and ultimately liver biopsy and histopathology.[1,6] Common clinical signs include lethargy, vomiting, weight loss, and decreased appetite.[1] Laboratory abnormalities can include elevations in liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, and coagulation disturbances, though normal liver enzyme activities do not rule out disease.[1,6,8,9] Ultrasonographic findings may reveal hepatobiliary abnormalities, but these are not specific for cholangitis.[1,12,13] Definitive diagnosis requires histopathological examination, which can distinguish neutrophilic, lymphocytic, or destructive subtypes of cholangitis.[1,6] Bacterial cultures of bile or liver are important to guide antibiotic therapy, as enteric bacteria like E. coli and Enterococcus spp. are commonly isolated.[3,8,11,23]

In summary, cholangitis is an important inflammatory condition affecting the hepatobiliary system in companion animals, with acute and chronic presentations that require a multimodal diagnostic approach and targeted antimicrobial therapy.

## Common Pathogens

Feline cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis syndrome (CCHS) is associated with a variety of underlying causes, including bacterial infections, parasitic infestations, and immune-mediated processes. Some common causative agents include:

[1] Bacterial infections, such as _Escherichia coli_, _Streptococcus_, _Clostridium_, _Bacteroides_, and _Actinomyces_ [1,2]. These opportunistic bacteria can invade the biliary system, particularly in the presence of bile duct obstruction or stasis.

[2] Parasitic infestations, including liver flukes (trematodes), which can directly infect and inflame the biliary ducts [1]. 

[3] Immune-mediated processes, which may drive lymphocytic or lymphoplasmacytic inflammation of the bile ducts and surrounding liver parenchyma. This can manifest as a primary cholangitis or as part of a more generalized inflammatory bowel disease or pancreatitis syndrome in cats [1].

In some cases, the inflammation and destruction of bile ducts can progress to a sclerosing cholangitis phenotype, leading to permanent bile duct loss and impaired bile flow [1].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Cats with cholangitis often present with nonspecific clinical signs such as poor appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, increased thirst and urination, fever, weight loss, abdominal pain, and jaundice [1,2]. 

Cats with neutrophilic cholangitis tend to have a more acute onset of symptoms (1-2 weeks) compared to cats with the lymphocytic form, which often have a more gradual onset over several weeks to months [3]. Some cats may also develop concurrent conditions like pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or chronic interstitial nephritis [2].

Diagnostically, cats with cholangitis often have elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST) and bilirubin levels. Imaging like abdominal ultrasound may reveal abnormalities in the liver, gallbladder, or bile ducts. Definitive diagnosis requires liver biopsy to assess the type and extent of inflammation [1,2].

## Diagnostic Methods

When a dog is suspected of having cholangitis, veterinarians will use a combination of diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis and identify any underlying causes.

Physical examination can reveal signs such as fever, lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, and abdominal pain or enlargement. [1][2][3] Blood tests, including a complete blood count and serum biochemistry profile, are often abnormal, showing increases in liver enzymes, bilirubin, and cholesterol. [1][2][3] 

Abdominal imaging, particularly ultrasound, is a key diagnostic tool. Ultrasound findings may include variability in liver echogenicity, gallbladder distension, and dilation of the extrahepatic or intrahepatic bile ducts. [1][2][3] These imaging changes can indicate obstruction, inflammation, or infection within the biliary system.

To confirm the diagnosis, liver and/or gallbladder biopsies are often recommended. Histopathology can identify the type of cholangitis present, such as neutrophilic, lymphocytic, or destructive. [1][4] Cultures of the bile and liver samples can also detect bacterial involvement. [1][2][3]

In some cases, additional diagnostics like abdominal radiographs, computed tomography, or exploratory surgery may be needed to fully evaluate the biliary tract and rule out other potential causes of the dog's clinical signs. [1][2][3]

Overall, a comprehensive diagnostic approach using physical exam, laboratory testing, imaging, and biopsies is often required to properly diagnose and characterize cholangitis in dogs. [1][2][3][4]

## Treatment Options

Cholangitis in cats is a serious condition that requires prompt medical management. The initial treatment approach involves stabilizing the cat and providing supportive care:

[1] Intravenous fluid therapy to correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. This helps support liver function. [2]

[2] Feeding the cat through a feeding tube to ensure adequate nutrition. Cats with cholangitis often have poor appetite. A high-calorie diet formulated for liver disease is recommended. [3]

[3] Broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat any bacterial infections. Common antibiotics used include enrofloxacin, metronidazole, and ampicillin-sulbactam. Antibiotic treatment is continued for 8-12 weeks or until liver enzymes normalize. [1,2]

[4] Ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol) to increase bile flow and remove inflammatory debris from the bile ducts. The dosage is 10-15 mg/kg given orally twice daily. [2]

[5] S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and vitamin E are used as antioxidants to help protect the liver. SAMe is given at 40 mg/kg orally once daily. [2]

[6] If the cholangitis is associated with an infected gallbladder or biliary obstruction, surgical intervention such as cholecystectomy may be required to resolve the underlying cause. [2,4]

Ongoing monitoring with bloodwork and imaging is important to assess response to treatment. Repeated liver biopsies may be needed in some cases. Cats with chronic or recurrent cholangitis often require long-term immunosuppressive therapy to control the inflammation.

## Preventive Measures

To prevent cholangitis in dogs, several strategies can be implemented:

[1] Vaccination: Routine vaccination against infectious diseases that can predispose dogs to cholangitis, such as leptospirosis, should be maintained. This helps reduce the risk of bacterial infections leading to cholangitis.

[2] Diet management: Feeding a high-quality, balanced diet and avoiding raw meat diets or scavenging of carcasses can help prevent the introduction of enteric bacteria that may translocate to the biliary system.

[3] Gallbladder and bile duct monitoring: Regular veterinary checkups with abdominal ultrasound can help detect early signs of gallbladder or bile duct disease, such as gallbladder mucocele or cholelithiasis. Prompt treatment of these conditions can prevent progression to cholangitis.

[4] Antibiotic stewardship: Responsible use of antibiotics, avoiding unnecessary or prolonged courses, can help prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections that may lead to cholangitis.

[5] Prompt treatment of concurrent conditions: Addressing any underlying gastrointestinal, pancreatic, or other disorders that may predispose the dog to cholangitis is important for prevention.

[6] Surgical intervention: For dogs with recurrent or chronic cholangitis associated with gallbladder or bile duct abnormalities, surgical procedures like cholecystectomy may be warranted to remove the source of infection and prevent further episodes.

By implementing these preventive measures, the risk of cholangitis in dogs can be reduced, and the overall health and well-being of the animal can be better maintained.

## Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating a dog with cholangitis, it is important to consider other diseases that can present with similar symptoms. Some key differential diagnoses include:

[1] Gallbladder mucocele: Thickened, distended gallbladder with inspissated bile can lead to biliary obstruction and secondary cholangitis. Ultrasound imaging is key for diagnosis. [2]

[2] Cholelithiasis (gallstones): Gallstones can obstruct bile flow and predispose to cholangitis. Abdominal imaging typically identifies the presence of mineralized gallbladder debris. [2]

[3] Pancreatitis: Inflammation of the pancreas can disrupt normal bile flow and lead to secondary cholangitis. Concurrent abdominal pain, vomiting, and elevated pancreatic enzymes may be present. [2]

[4] Inflammatory bowel disease: Chronic gastrointestinal inflammation can allow bacterial translocation and ascending cholangitis. Diagnostic workup should include abdominal imaging and intestinal biopsies. [2,17]

[5] Liver neoplasia: Space-occupying lesions in the liver or biliary tract can obstruct bile flow and cause cholestasis and secondary cholangitis. Imaging and liver biopsy are needed for diagnosis. [2]

To distinguish cholangitis from these other conditions, a combination of diagnostic testing is required, including bloodwork, abdominal imaging, and in many cases, liver or gallbladder biopsy and culture. Careful evaluation of the clinical signs, laboratory abnormalities, and imaging findings is crucial to arrive at the correct diagnosis. [1,2,7,10,17]
