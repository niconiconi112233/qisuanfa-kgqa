## Disease Overview

Canine brucellosis is an infectious and zoonotic disease caused by the bacteria *Brucella canis*. *B. canis* is the most common cause of canine brucellosis, although dogs can also rarely be infected with other *Brucella* species like *B. melitensis*, *B. abortus*, or *B. suis* [1,2].

*B. canis* infection has been reported worldwide, with the exception of Antarctica [1,3]. While the literature suggests *B. canis* has a global distribution, there is a lack of comprehensive epidemiological studies to determine the true prevalence of canine brucellosis in many countries [1,4]. This is likely due to the challenges in accurately diagnosing the disease, as serological tests have limited accuracy [1,5].

Transmission of *B. canis* to dogs occurs primarily through the oronasal route, when they come into contact with contaminated tissues such as aborted fetuses, semen, urine, and vaginal secretions [1]. Venereal transmission during breeding is an important route of infection [1,6]. Large numbers of bacteria are shed into the environment after abortions or through reproductive fluids, so fomites play a key role in disease spread [1,7]. Infected dogs can remain asymptomatic carriers and shed the bacteria intermittently, posing a persistent risk to other dogs and to humans [1,8].

In humans, *B. canis* infection is considered an occupational disease, with veterinarians, breeders, and laboratory workers who handle infected animals or samples being at highest risk of exposure [1,9,10]. Human brucellosis caused by *B. canis* typically presents with non-specific flu-like symptoms, although more severe manifestations like endocarditis and neurological complications have been reported [1,11,12]. Due to the challenges in clinical and laboratory diagnosis, human *B. canis* infections are likely underdiagnosed [1,13].

## Common Pathogens

Canine brucellosis is primarily caused by the bacterium Brucella canis (B. canis). However, dogs can also become infected with other Brucella species associated with livestock, such as B. abortus, B. suis, and B. melitensis, depending on their exposure to infected animals or their tissues and secretions.[1,2] 

B. canis is the most common cause of canine brucellosis worldwide.[1,3] Outbreaks have been reported in kennels, and serological surveys have shown higher infection rates in stray dogs compared to owned dogs, likely due to the lack of breeding control in stray populations.[1,4,5] 

While B. canis is the primary pathogen, dogs may also become infected with other Brucella species if they have close contact with infected livestock, such as ingesting raw meat, birth fluids, or being exposed to contaminated environments. Farm dogs, hunting dogs, and dogs in rural areas are at higher risk of these less common Brucella infections.[2]

In summary, the main pathogens associated with canine brucellosis are:

1. Brucella canis (B. canis) - the most common cause in dogs
2. Brucella abortus, Brucella suis, Brucella melitensis - less common but can infect dogs through exposure to infected livestock

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Canine brucellosis caused by the bacteria _Brucella canis_ can lead to a range of clinical symptoms and signs in infected dogs. The most common manifestations are related to the reproductive system:

Female dogs may experience late-term abortion, stillborn puppies, and early death of live-born puppies. Infected male dogs may develop abnormally sized testicles, either swollen or shrunken [1]. Other non-reproductive signs can include infertility, anorexia, weight loss, pain, lameness, incoordination, swollen lymph nodes, and muscle weakness [1].

Some dogs may remain asymptomatic for years, especially if they are spayed or neutered [3]. However, the infection can still lead to ocular abnormalities like recurrent blepharospasm, miosis, and uveitis, as well as musculoskeletal disorders such as arthritis or diskospondylitis [3]. Fever is not a common clinical sign in dogs with brucellosis, unlike in other species [3].

## Diagnostic Methods

Canine brucellosis caused by the bacteria _Brucella canis_ can be challenging to diagnose, as the clinical signs are often vague and nonspecific. The gold standard for diagnosis is direct detection of the bacteria through culture or PCR assays [1,2]. However, these methods have limitations as the bacteria may be shed intermittently, leading to false-negative results.

Serological testing is more commonly used for screening and diagnosis of canine brucellosis. The previously popular Rapid Slide Agglutination Test (RSAT) has been discontinued, making testing more difficult [1]. The Animal Health Diagnostic Center at Cornell University now offers a new [**Canine Brucella Multiplex test**](https://www.vet.cornell.edu/animal-health-diagnostic-center/testing/testing-protocols-interpretations/brucella-multiplex-testing-dogs) which combines multiple serologic tests (RSAT, AGID, and 2ME-RSAT) to improve diagnostic accuracy [1,6]. However, false-negatives may still occur, especially early in infection before antibodies have fully developed [1].

Other serological tests include the agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test, tube agglutination test (TAT), and indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay [2,7,8]. These tests can help detect antibodies to _B. canis_, but their sensitivity and specificity vary. Confirmatory testing with a more specific assay like the AGID may be required, especially when using less specific tests like the ELISA or lateral flow assay [9,10].

Overall, diagnosis of canine brucellosis remains challenging due to the intermittent nature of bacterial shedding and the limitations of currently available diagnostic tests. A combination of clinical signs, direct detection, and serological testing is often necessary to make an accurate diagnosis [1-3].

## Treatment Options

Canine brucellosis is a challenging infection to treat, as there is no definitive cure and the bacteria can persist even after extended antibiotic therapy. However, there are several treatment approaches that may be attempted:

Spaying/Neutering: Removing the reproductive organs of an infected dog can reduce bacterial shedding, though it does not eliminate the infection entirely. This is often recommended as a first step before starting antibiotic treatment.[1]

Antibiotic Therapy: Various antibiotic protocols have been used, typically involving a combination of drugs such as doxycycline, minocycline, enrofloxacin, streptomycin, rifampin, and chloramphenicol. These are often given for 4-12 weeks, but even aggressive treatment does not guarantee complete elimination of the bacteria.[2,3] Relapses are common.

Monitoring and Supportive Care: Dogs treated for brucellosis require close monitoring, with serial testing to ensure clearance of the bacteria. Supportive care such as managing any clinical signs is also important.[1]

Despite treatment attempts, infected dogs are considered to have a lifelong infection and may continue to intermittently shed the bacteria. For this reason, euthanasia is often recommended, especially in breeding kennels, to prevent transmission to other dogs and potential zoonotic spread to humans.[4,5]

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination and environmental management are crucial strategies to prevent the spread of canine brucellosis. Live attenuated *Brucella* vaccines play a critical role in providing immune protection to animals against brucellosis [1]. However, there are currently no commercially available vaccines for preventing canine brucellosis caused by *Brucella canis* [2]. 

To avoid contamination and accidental vaccine exposure to other animals, it is important to maintain separate syringes and needles for brucellosis vaccination [3]. The *B. canis* vaccine should be administered subcutaneously in two doses, 2-4 weeks apart [3]. 

In addition to vaccination, proper disinfection of contaminated environments is essential. *Brucella* is killed by many common disinfectants, such as sodium hypochlorite, glutaraldehyde, and phenolic compounds [2]. These disinfectants should be mixed according to manufacturer instructions and allowed to sit on surfaces for at least 10 minutes before washing them away. If the surface has bodily fluids, a degreaser should be applied first before disinfecting [2].

Strict biosecurity measures are also crucial in kennels and breeding facilities to prevent the spread of *B. canis*. This includes segregating feeding utensils, equipment, and materials to avoid cross-contamination [2]. Introduction of new dogs into a kennel should be preceded by testing for *B. canis* infection to prevent introduction of the disease [2]. Proper isolation and culling of infected dogs is also recommended to control outbreaks.

## Differential Diagnosis

Canine brucellosis can be challenging to diagnose definitively, as the clinical signs and laboratory test results can be nonspecific or inconsistent. Several key points regarding the differential diagnosis of canine brucellosis include:

[1] Routine tests like serum biochemistry, CBC, and urinalysis are typically normal in dogs with brucellosis. The definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of the causative bacteria, _Brucella canis_, through culture or PCR assay. [1]

[2] Serological tests like the rapid slide agglutination test (RSAT), tube agglutination test (TAT), agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID), and ELISA can be used, but have varying sensitivity and specificity. False positives and false negatives are common, especially early in infection. [1,2]

[3] Acute infection may not have developed sufficient antibody titers for detection in the first 3 weeks, leading to false negatives. Chronic cases may have waning antibody levels, also causing false negatives. [2]

[4] The "gold standard" for diagnosis remains bacterial culture, but this can also be challenging as the bacteria may be shed intermittently and may not survive transport. Culture of aborted materials or reproductive secretions is most successful. [1]

[5] Other diseases that can produce similar reproductive, musculoskeletal, or ocular signs as canine brucellosis, such as infertility, abortions, discospondylitis, and uveitis, must be considered in the differential diagnosis. [1]
