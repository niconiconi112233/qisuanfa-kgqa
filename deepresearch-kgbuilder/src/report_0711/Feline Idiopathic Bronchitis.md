## Disease Overview

Feline idiopathic bronchitis, also known as feline asthma or feline allergic bronchitis, is a relatively common lower airway disease in cats. It is characterized by chronic or recurrent inflammation of the airways, leading to bronchoconstriction and airflow limitation. 

The condition typically affects young to middle-aged cats, with Siamese cats being predisposed. The exact cause is unknown, but it is believed to involve an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction to environmental triggers. Feline idiopathic bronchitis can be classified into two main phenotypes - asthma (with eosinophilic inflammation) and chronic bronchitis (with neutrophilic inflammation). Some cats may have features of both.

Clinical signs include coughing, wheezing, exercise intolerance, and acute respiratory distress. Diagnosis involves ruling out other causes of respiratory disease and confirming the presence of lower airway inflammation through techniques like thoracic radiography and bronchoalveolar lavage. Treatment aims to control inflammation and manage acute exacerbations, often involving corticosteroids and bronchodilators.

## Common Pathogens

Feline bronchitis can have a variety of underlying causes, including viral, bacterial, and other potential triggers. Some common pathogens associated with feline bronchitis include:

Viral infections: Feline calicivirus, feline herpesvirus, and feline coronavirus have all been implicated in causing bronchitis in cats.[1] These viruses can lead to inflammation and irritation of the airways.

Bacterial infections: Bacterial species such as Bordetella bronchiseptica, Mycoplasma spp., and Streptococcus spp. can infect the lower airways and contribute to bronchitis.[1] Recurrent bacterial infections may also worsen or perpetuate existing bronchial inflammation.

Environmental irritants: Exposure to cigarette smoke, dust, pollen, or other airborne pollutants can trigger bronchial inflammation and bronchitis in susceptible cats.[1] Chronic exposure to such irritants may make cats more prone to developing bronchial disease.

Parasitic infections: Lungworm (Aelurostrongylus abstrusus) and heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) infections can also cause bronchial inflammation and bronchitis in cats.[1] The migrating larvae and adult worms can damage the airways.

In summary, feline bronchitis can stem from a variety of infectious agents, both viral and bacterial, as well as environmental exposures and parasitic infestations. Understanding the underlying cause is important for proper treatment and management of this respiratory condition in cats.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Cats with lower airway disease typically present with variable clinical signs, often showing a chronic cough or an acute respiratory crisis. In the chronic form, cats may have sporadic or frequent coughing episodes, but appear normal between coughing fits. In the acute state, owners may notice signs of respiratory distress such as increased respiratory rate and effort, open-mouth breathing, and wheezing or crackles on auscultation [1].

The type of clinical presentation can help differentiate between the two main forms of lower airway disease - asthma and chronic bronchitis. Cats with asthma tend to have predominately expiratory dyspnea, with a marked expiratory push or even expiratory grunt. They may also exhibit open-mouth breathing and/or orthopnea. In contrast, cats with chronic bronchitis may have more subtle clinical signs, with only moderate to severe respiratory distress when in crisis [1].

Physical exam findings can also help distinguish the two conditions. Cats with asthma often have auscultable wheezes, characteristic of the airway narrowing and airflow limitation that occurs. Cats with either condition are typically normothermic and have a normal heart rate, helping differentiate them from cats with heart failure as a cause of respiratory distress [1].

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosing feline bronchitis involves a comprehensive clinical approach. The first step is often obtaining a thorough history and performing a physical examination to assess the cat's respiratory signs and overall health status. [1] 

Radiographic imaging of the thorax can reveal a generalized bronchointerstitial pattern consistent with bronchial inflammation, as well as other abnormalities like atelectasis or spontaneous pneumothorax. [1] Cardiac ultrasound can help rule out cardiac causes of respiratory distress. [1]

However, definitive diagnosis requires obtaining lower airway samples, typically via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), for cytological analysis. [1] BAL samples can identify the predominant inflammatory cell type, with eosinophilic inflammation characteristic of asthma and neutrophilic inflammation indicative of chronic bronchitis. [1,2] Cultures and PCR testing of these samples can also detect infectious agents like Mycoplasma. [1]

Bronchoscopy can provide additional information on endobronchial abnormalities, but is less commonly performed in cats. [1] Other diagnostic tests, such as pulmonary function testing, are not routinely available for cats at this time. [1]

## Treatment Options

Feline bronchitis can be a challenging condition to manage, but there are several treatment approaches that can help alleviate symptoms and slow disease progression.

The primary treatment for feline bronchitis involves the use of medications to reduce airway inflammation and improve breathing. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone or prednisolone, are commonly prescribed to decrease inflammation in the airways [1]. These medications are often administered orally or through inhalation therapy using a nebulizer. Antibiotics may also be used if a secondary bacterial infection is present.

Supportive care is another important aspect of managing feline bronchitis. Maintaining a stress-free environment and minimizing exposure to potential irritants, such as cigarette smoke or strong odors, can help prevent flare-ups [2]. Providing supplemental oxygen and ensuring proper hydration are also important steps in supportive care.

Nursing management of cats with bronchitis includes techniques to facilitate the clearance of mucus from the airways. This may involve providing moisture through steam or nebulization, as well as gently encouraging coughing and expectoration. Proper grooming and regular nail trimming can also help prevent additional airway irritation [3].

While chronic bronchitis in cats is often not curable, with appropriate treatment and management, many cats can experience an improved quality of life and reduced frequency of symptoms.

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is an important preventive measure for managing feline bronchitis. The American Association of Feline Practitioners recommends that all healthy kittens and adult cats without a known vaccination history should be routinely vaccinated with an intranasal or parenteral vaccine that contains feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) and feline calicivirus (FCV) [1]. This helps protect against the primary viral pathogens that cause upper respiratory infections in cats.

In addition to vaccination, environmental management is crucial for preventing and controlling feline bronchitis. Eliminating potential allergens and irritants in the cat's environment, such as cigarette smoke, perfumes, pollens, molds, and dust, can help reduce triggers for respiratory distress [2,6]. Improving ventilation to provide adequate air exchanges per hour is also recommended [1].

For cats at high risk of exposure, such as those in shelters or multi-cat households, additional preventive measures may be warranted. This includes separating vaccinated cats from unvaccinated cats, as well as isolating cats with a history of respiratory disease from healthy cats [1]. Proper cleaning and disinfection of feeding and housing areas can also help minimize the spread of infectious agents.

## Differential Diagnosis

Bronchitis in cats can share similar symptoms with other respiratory diseases, so it is important to differentiate between them. Other conditions that may present with coughing, breathing difficulties, and respiratory distress include:

- Feline asthma - Feline asthma is a condition characterized by reversible airway constriction and inflammation, often with an allergic component. It can be difficult to distinguish from chronic bronchitis based on clinical signs alone. [1,2]

- Cardiomyopathy - Heart disease such as cardiomyopathy can lead to fluid buildup in the lungs and respiratory distress. Physical exam findings and diagnostic tests like echocardiography can help differentiate this from bronchitis. [2]

- Bronchiectasis - Chronic airway dilation and scarring, known as bronchiectasis, can cause recurring respiratory infections and chronic cough. [2,17]

- Parasitic infections - Lung worms and heartworm disease can both cause respiratory signs like coughing and breathing difficulties. Diagnostic tests for these parasites can confirm the underlying cause. [2]

- Neoplasia - Primary or metastatic lung tumors may present with cough, weight loss, and other respiratory signs similar to bronchitis. Imaging and biopsy can distinguish neoplasia. [2]

- Interstitial lung disease - Conditions affecting the lung parenchyma, such as pulmonary fibrosis, can lead to airway changes and respiratory distress. [18,19]

Thoracic radiographs, cardiac ultrasound, and airway sampling through bronchoalveolar lavage are important diagnostic tests to help differentiate bronchitis from these other potential causes of respiratory disease in cats. [2]
