## Disease Overview

Copper storage disease in companion animals is a relatively common condition caused by an inherited genetic mutation that prevents the liver from effectively eliminating excess copper from the body. This leads to a dangerous buildup of copper in the liver, causing inflammation, cellular damage, and potentially life-threatening liver failure if left untreated.[1,2]

The disease primarily affects certain dog breeds, including Bedlington Terriers, West Highland White Terriers, Dalmatians, Labrador Retrievers, and Doberman Pinschers.[2] While rare, cats can also develop copper storage disease.[3] 

Symptoms typically do not appear until the disease is quite advanced, and can include lethargy, decreased appetite, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, increased thirst and urination, jaundice, and pale gums (if anemia develops).[2] Without prompt diagnosis and treatment, the prognosis is generally poor, with dogs surviving an average of 18 months after diagnosis.[2]

## Common Pathogens

Copper storage disease, also known as copper toxicosis, is a condition in which excess copper accumulates in the liver and other organs. This disease is not caused by a specific pathogen, but rather by an imbalance in copper metabolism within the body. 

The primary cause of copper storage disease is a genetic deficiency in the enzyme that helps the body excrete excess copper. This genetic disorder is most commonly seen in certain breeds of dogs, such as Bedlington Terriers, Doberman Pinschers, and Skye Terriers [1]. In these breeds, the inability to properly metabolize and eliminate copper leads to a gradual buildup of the mineral in the liver and other tissues, which can eventually cause liver damage and other health problems.

While copper storage disease is not an infectious disease, other underlying conditions or infections can contribute to the development or progression of the condition. For example, certain bacterial or viral infections that affect the liver may impair its ability to process and excrete copper, exacerbating the problem [2]. Therefore, addressing any underlying health issues is important in the management of copper storage disease.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

The key clinical symptoms and physical signs associated with copper storage disease in dogs and cats include:

[1] Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) due to the accumulation of copper in the liver. [2] Lethargy, decreased appetite, and weight loss. [3] Vomiting and diarrhea. [4] Increased thirst and urination. [5] Abdominal discomfort, swelling, and pain. [6] Fever, weakness, and lethargy. [7] Pale gums (if anemia has developed). [8] Ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen).

Copper storage disease can affect any breed, but it is more common in certain breeds like Bedlington Terriers, West Highland White Terriers, Dalmatians, Doberman Pinschers, and Labrador Retrievers. The disease is often not diagnosed until it is in an advanced stage, at which point the symptoms can become severe. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for improving the prognosis.

## Diagnostic Methods

The various diagnostic tests and approaches used to identify copper storage disease include:

[1] Clinical presentation: Dogs with copper storage disease may exhibit nonspecific symptoms such as lethargy, decreased appetite, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, increased thirst and urination, and jaundice. In severe cases, they may also present with acute hemolytic crises.

[2] Laboratory testing: Routine blood work can reveal increased liver enzyme activities, particularly alanine transaminase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Other abnormalities may include hypoalbuminemia, hypoglycemia, and hypocholesterolemia. Hepatic function tests like bile acids and ammonia can also be used to assess liver disease, but are not specific for copper storage disease.

[3] Liver biopsy: This is the definitive diagnostic test. Histologic examination of liver samples stained with specialized stains (e.g. rhodanine, rubeanic acid) can reveal the distribution and amount of copper accumulation within hepatocytes. Quantitative copper analysis of the liver tissue by atomic absorption spectroscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis.

[4] Imaging: Abdominal ultrasound can provide clues about the chronicity of liver disease, such as an irregular, nodular, or small liver, but does not specifically diagnose copper storage disease. Cytology of fine-needle aspirates may detect copper-laden hepatocytes, but has limited sensitivity.

In summary, the combination of clinical signs, breed predisposition, laboratory abnormalities, and definitive diagnosis through liver biopsy and copper quantification is required to identify copper storage disease in dogs.

## Treatment Options

Dogs with copper storage disease require lifelong management to control their copper levels and support liver health. The main treatment approaches include:

[1] Dietary management - Switching the dog to a low-copper diet, such as Hill's l/d or Royal Canin Hepatic, to limit further copper accumulation in the liver. These diets typically contain around 1.2-1.3 mg of copper per 1000 kcal.

[2] Chelation therapy - Medications like D-penicillamine or trientine that bind to excess copper in the body and help it get excreted through the urine. This can take months to years to effectively remove accumulated copper.

[3] Zinc supplementation - Zinc helps block the absorption of copper in the intestines, preventing further buildup in the liver. Zinc gluconate is a common form used.

[4] Antioxidant supplements - Products containing S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), milk thistle, and vitamin E can help protect the liver from oxidative damage caused by excess copper.

[5] Ursodiol - This bile acid can help improve bile flow and reduce inflammation in the liver.

[6] Glucocorticoids - Anti-inflammatory steroids like prednisolone may be used short-term to reduce liver inflammation.

Regular monitoring through liver biopsies, blood tests, and follow-up visits is crucial to ensure the treatments are effectively managing the dog's copper levels and liver disease. With the right combination of therapies, many dogs with copper storage disease can have their liver function restored and go on to live a good quality of life. [1,2,3,4]

## Preventive Measures

To reduce the risk or impact of copper storage disease, there are several key preventive steps that can be taken:

Diet: Feeding a low-copper diet is crucial. Prescription diets like Hill's l/d and Royal Canin Hepatic Support are specially formulated to have very low copper levels, around 0.1 mg per 100 kcal [1]. For homemade diets, ingredients high in copper like organ meats, shellfish, and mushrooms should be avoided. Adding zinc can also help reduce copper absorption [2].

Vaccination: There is no direct link between vaccination and copper storage disease. However, keeping dogs up-to-date on their vaccinations helps support overall health and liver function, which is important for managing this condition.

Environmental management: Avoid sources of excess copper in the environment, such as copper pipes providing drinking water. Flushing the water line for 5 minutes before use can help minimize copper intake from this source [3].

Regular monitoring: Bloodwork and periodic liver biopsies can help detect copper accumulation early, before significant liver damage occurs. This allows for prompt dietary and medical intervention [4].

Selective breeding: For breeds predisposed to primary copper storage disease, genetic testing and selective breeding to avoid affected lines is recommended to prevent passing on the genetic defect [5].

By implementing these preventive measures, the risk and impact of copper storage disease can be greatly reduced, allowing affected dogs to live longer, healthier lives.

## Differential Diagnosis

When diagnosing copper storage disease, it is important to consider other diseases with similar symptoms that must be ruled out. Some key differential diagnoses include:

[1] Chronic hepatitis: Chronic inflammation of the liver can lead to accumulation of copper and other minerals, resulting in symptoms like lethargy, poor appetite, and weight loss. Distinguishing chronic hepatitis from copper storage disease may require liver biopsy and copper quantification. [2]

[2] Portosystemic shunts: Congenital or acquired abnormal blood vessels that bypass the liver can cause similar clinical signs as copper storage disease, including neurological symptoms like disorientation and seizures. Imaging tests like ultrasound or CT scan are used to diagnose portosystemic shunts. [2]

[3] Infectious hepatitis: Viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections of the liver can cause acute or chronic inflammation and clinical signs mimicking copper storage disease. Diagnostic tests like blood work, imaging, and biopsy are required to identify the underlying infectious cause. [2]

[4] Hepatic neoplasia: Primary liver tumors or metastatic cancer can lead to liver dysfunction and similar clinical presentation as copper storage disease. Imaging, biopsy, and advanced diagnostics are needed to diagnose neoplasia. [2]

[5] Nutritional hepatopathies: Dietary imbalances, including excess copper intake, can contribute to liver disease. Careful review of the pet's diet and consideration of nutritional causes are warranted. [2]

In summary, a comprehensive diagnostic workup including bloodwork, imaging, and liver biopsy is crucial to differentiate copper storage disease from other potential causes of chronic liver disease in dogs. The breed predisposition and copper-specific histological findings are key to establishing the diagnosis of copper storage disease.
