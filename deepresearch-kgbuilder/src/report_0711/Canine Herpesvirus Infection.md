## Disease Overview

Canine herpesvirus infection is a severe viral infection that primarily affects puppies under 3 weeks old, with mortality rates often reaching 100% in affected litters. The virus is transmitted through close contact with infectious oral, nasal, or vaginal secretions, and can also be passed from infected pregnant bitches to their fetuses. 

Clinical signs in puppies are nonspecific and can include anorexia, weight loss, inappropriate vocalization, blindness, abdominal distension, dyspnea, and diarrhea. Diagnosis is challenging before death, but can be confirmed through virus isolation, PCR, or serology after necropsy. Treatment is mainly supportive care, as the prognosis is poor once clinical signs appear.

In adult dogs, CHV infections are often subclinical but can manifest as mild upper respiratory or ocular disease. Seroprevalence in dog populations can range from 20-98% depending on the region, as the virus establishes latent infections that can reactivate under stress or immunosuppression. Preventive measures like isolation of pregnant bitches and good biosecurity practices are important to reduce transmission, but no vaccine is currently available in the US. [1,2,4]

## Common Pathogens

Canine herpesvirus (CHV) is a common pathogen that can cause severe disease in dogs, particularly neonatal puppies. The virus is an enveloped DNA virus that is relatively unstable outside the host, requiring close contact for transmission [1].

CHV is usually transmitted through contact with the infected oral, nasal, or vaginal secretions of shedding dogs. Many dogs that are shedding the virus show no clinical signs [1]. Pregnant bitches that are naïve to the virus are at risk of acute infection, which can be transmitted to fetuses or neonatal puppies. However, previously infected bitches are unlikely to transmit the infection [1].  

The most severe systemic disease occurs in fetal or neonatal puppies as a result of in utero infection or infection in the first 3 weeks of life. After this time, natural resistance to infection improves as puppies mature and maintain a higher body temperature [1].

In addition to the severe disease in neonatal puppies, CHV infection has also been detected in adult dogs with upper respiratory infections, ocular disease, or vesicular vaginitis/posthitis, as well as in asymptomatic dogs [1]. The seroprevalence of CHV in dog populations worldwide ranges from 20-98%, indicating that it is a very common pathogen [1].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Canine herpesvirus infection is best known as a severe viral infection of puppies. Canine herpesvirus replicates more efficiently at the lower body temperatures maintained by neonates, so deaths due to CHV infection typically occur in puppies 1–3 weeks old, occasionally in puppies up to 1 month old, and rarely in pups as old as 6 months [1]. 

The clinical signs of canine herpesvirus infection are often nonspecific. In neonatal puppies, the disease is characterized by severe nonspecific systemic signs, including diarrhea, inappetence, lack of weight gain, tachypnea, pneumonia, corneal edema, and conjunctivitis [1]. Notably, puppies do not typically exhibit fever. The illness progresses rapidly, and failure to thrive or sudden death are common outcomes [1].

In older dogs, CHV infection may cause mild upper respiratory tract signs such as cough, sneezing, and nasal discharge, which may be part of the "kennel cough" syndrome [1]. Adult dogs may also develop vesicular vaginitis or posthitis, as well as conjunctivitis and dendritic corneal ulcers [1]. Pregnant bitches acutely infected may abort a litter or deliver a partially stillborn litter, but they seldom exhibit other clinical signs [1].

## Diagnostic Methods

Canine herpesvirus infection is often difficult to diagnose antemortem, as the clinical signs are often nonspecific. However, prompt clinical recognition is key to achieving an antemortem diagnosis [1].

Diagnostic testing may include serologic assays, such as hemagglutination, ELISA, and immunofluorescence antibody tests [1]. These can be used to detect antibodies against the virus. Additionally, PCR testing on fresh tissue and fluid samples is highly sensitive and specific for detecting the virus directly [1,2].

In cases of neonatal mortality, the diagnosis is typically made postmortem. Necropsy of a deceased puppy in an affected litter, along with virus isolation from fresh lung, liver, kidney, and spleen samples, followed by identification using PCR, electron microscopy, or other techniques, is often the most efficient diagnostic strategy [1,3,4].

It is important to note that canine herpesvirus infection may be confused with other conditions, such as infectious canine hepatitis or canine distemper, so a thorough diagnostic workup is necessary [1].

## Treatment Options

Canine herpesvirus infection is a rapidly progressing and often fatal disease, particularly in puppies under 3 weeks old. There is no specific treatment, and the prognosis is generally poor once clinical signs appear. 

The mainstay of treatment is supportive care, which may include [1]:

- Balanced IV fluids to address dehydration and maintain volume status
- Anti-nausea medications
- Supplemental oxygen
- Antimicrobials for secondary bacterial infections
- Active warming
- Supplemental nutrition

In some cases, antiviral medications like acyclovir have been used, but their efficacy is limited [2]. Passive immunization with serum from previously infected bitches may help reduce risk in exposed litters before clinical signs appear [1].

For adult dogs with milder respiratory or ocular forms of the disease, topical ophthalmic antivirals like cidofovir or trifluridine may be helpful [1]. However, in most cases, the disease course is self-limiting in older dogs.

Overall, the priority is early recognition and supportive care, as well as measures to prevent transmission, since there is no vaccine available in the US [1]. Strict isolation of pregnant bitches and neonatal puppies is crucial to minimize spread and losses within a litter.

## Preventive Measures

Canine herpesvirus infection is a significant threat to pregnant dogs and their puppies. The most effective prevention strategies focus on limiting exposure and supporting the immune system.

Performing herpesvirus titer testing on breeding females before mating is crucial. This provides insight into the bitch's immune status and risk of viral reactivation during pregnancy. For bitches with low titers, strict biosecurity measures should be implemented to minimize exposure to potential CHV carriers. This includes isolating the pregnant dog from other dogs, especially those in high-stress environments.

In addition to environmental control, immune system support is vital. Providing the bitch with a nutrient-dense diet, supplements like bovine colostrum, and strategies to reduce stress can help bolster her defenses against viral reactivation. 

For puppies, maintaining a warm environment is important, as the virus replicates more efficiently at lower body temperatures. If exposure is suspected, administering immune serum from a CHV-immune donor can provide immediate passive immunity to help protect the litter.

While there is no commercial vaccine available in the US, these proactive measures focusing on pre-breeding assessment, environmental management, and immune support can significantly reduce the risk of CHV-associated reproductive losses in breeding programs.

## Differential Diagnosis

Canine herpesvirus infection can cause a range of clinical symptoms that may overlap with other diseases, so it is important to consider differential diagnoses. Some key points on differentiating canine herpesvirus from other conditions:

[1] Canine infectious hepatitis (caused by canine adenovirus-1) can also cause acute febrile illness, lethargy, and gastrointestinal signs similar to canine herpesvirus. However, canine infectious hepatitis is typically accompanied by more severe liver involvement, including jaundice, and characteristic liver and gallbladder lesions. [2]

[2] Canine distemper virus can produce respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological signs, but it is usually associated with a characteristic biphasic fever pattern and the development of inclusion bodies in various cell types. In contrast, dogs with canine herpesvirus do not typically exhibit fever. [3]

[3] Neosporosis in dogs can cause a fulminant, multisystemic disease, but the associated neurological signs, such as seizures, are more prominent compared to canine herpesvirus infection. Neospora infection should be considered in cases with neurological involvement. [4]

[4] Bacterial and fungal infections may produce clinical signs similar to canine herpesvirus, such as pneumonia or sepsis, but they typically do not lead to the rapid clinical deterioration and high mortality seen with acute neonatal herpesvirus infections. Diagnostic testing can help distinguish these etiologies.

In summary, while the clinical presentation of canine herpesvirus can be nonspecific, consideration of the relatively acute onset, lack of fever, and high mortality rate in neonatal puppies can help differentiate it from other potential causes of systemic illness in dogs. Diagnostic testing remains essential for confirming the diagnosis.

# Pet Disease: Canine Herpesvirus Infection

Canine herpesvirus is a severe viral infection that primarily affects young puppies, with mortality rates often reaching 100% in affected litters. While adult dogs may show mild respiratory or ocular signs, the disease is particularly devastating in neonates, leading to rapid deterioration and death. This report examines the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, treatment options, and preventive strategies for canine herpesvirus infection, drawing insights from authoritative veterinary sources.

## Summary

Canine herpesvirus is a highly contagious pathogen transmitted through close contact with infectious secretions. Neonatal puppies are most susceptible, often succumbing to systemic disease within weeks of infection. Diagnosis is challenging before death, but can be confirmed through virus isolation, PCR, or serology. Treatment is limited to supportive care, as there is no specific antiviral therapy. 

Preventive measures are crucial, including isolating pregnant bitches, providing immune support, and maintaining a warm environment for puppies. While no vaccine is currently available, these proactive strategies can significantly reduce the risk of devastating CHV-associated losses in breeding programs. Overall, early recognition and a comprehensive approach to biosecurity and immune system support are key to managing this pervasive canine disease.
