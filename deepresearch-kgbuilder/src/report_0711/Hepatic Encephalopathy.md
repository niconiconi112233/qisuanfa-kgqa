## Disease Overview

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neurological condition that develops secondary to liver disease, most commonly associated with a portosystemic shunt (PSS) in dogs and cats. HE results from the accumulation of toxins, such as ammonia, in the bloodstream due to impaired liver function. This leads to neurological symptoms ranging from mild confusion to coma and can be life-threatening if not properly managed. 

HE is characterized as either acute, occurring with fulminant liver failure, or chronic, associated with longstanding liver disease and portosystemic shunting. Clinical signs can vary widely, from subtle behavioral changes to profound neurological deficits like head pressing, aimless wandering, seizures, and coma. Diagnosis relies on ruling out other neurological conditions and evaluating liver function.

The pathogenesis of HE involves a complex interplay of factors, including hyperammonemia, inflammatory mediators, and altered neurotransmitter systems. Treatments aim to reduce ammonia production, improve liver function, and provide supportive care. Dietary modifications, lactulose, antimicrobials, and managing precipitating factors are key components of management. With prompt recognition and appropriate treatment, the prognosis for animals with HE can be improved.

## Common Pathogens

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is most frequently associated with portosystemic shunting (PSS) in dogs and cats, either congenital or acquired [1]. While increased blood ammonia is the most commonly cited cause, other factors such as mercaptan, amino acid imbalances, and abnormalities of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor can also contribute to the development of HE [1,2].

Portosystemic shunting allows blood to bypass the liver, preventing detoxification of ammonia and other potentially toxic substances. This leads to the accumulation of these substances in the systemic circulation, which can then cross the blood-brain barrier and cause neurological dysfunction [1,2]. 

In addition to PSS, HE may also occur in other hepatic disorders that lead to end-stage liver failure, such as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or toxic hepatopathies [1,2]. Factors that can precipitate or exacerbate HE include sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, constipation, excess dietary protein, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and certain medications [1,2].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities seen in pets with liver dysfunction. The clinical signs can vary widely, ranging from mild confusion and lethargy to severe symptoms like circling, head pressing, blindness, and coma. [1]

In the early stages of HE, pets may show mild symptoms such as inappetence, dull demeanor, and mild irritability. As the condition progresses, more pronounced clinical signs can develop, including lethargy, ataxia, disorientation, ptyalism (excessive drooling), and even seizures. [2] 

In the later stages of HE, pets can become completely unresponsive and recumbent, with signs of cerebral edema like head pressing and blindness. Ultimately, untreated HE can lead to coma and death. [3]

The clinical presentation of HE is often episodic, with symptoms worsening after meals, and pets may have periods of normal behavior interspersed with relapses. Careful monitoring and serial neurological exams are important for early detection and management. [1]

## Diagnostic Methods

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities seen in patients with liver dysfunction after exclusion of other known brain disease [1]. HE is most frequently found in association with some form of portosystemic shunt (PSS) in dogs and cats, but may also occur in other hepatic disorders that lead to end-stage liver failure [1].

There is no definitive diagnostic test for HE, therefore a diagnosis is based on the presence of consistent clinical signs, the exclusion of other causes of encephalopathy, laboratory findings, imaging studies, and response to treatment [2]. Hyperammonaemia is the most commonly cited cause, but the clinical signs can also be associated with several other metabolites including mercaptan, amino acid imbalances and abnormalities of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor [1,2].

Blood tests are useful in determining liver function, and should include:

- Total protein
- Albumin 
- Blood urea nitrogen
- Total cholesterol
- Glucose
- Total bilirubin
- Ammonium
- Total bile acids [2]

Hyperammonaemia indicates PSS or hepatic insufficiency, and measurement of pre- and post-prandial bile acid concentration is a useful test for diagnosing hepatobiliary disease, including PSS [2]. 

A definitive diagnosis of PSS requires diagnostic imaging or surgical exploration. Techniques include angiography, abdominal ultrasonography, portal scintigraphy, computed tomography angiography and MRI angiography [2].

## Treatment Options

Hepatic encephalopathy in pets can be a serious and life-threatening condition, so prompt and effective treatment is crucial. The key treatment approaches include:

[1] Stabilizing the patient: This involves addressing any underlying conditions or precipitating factors that may be contributing to the hepatic encephalopathy, such as dehydration, infections, or electrolyte imbalances. Supportive care with intravenous fluids and medications may be necessary.

[2] Reducing ammonia levels: Medications like lactulose and antibiotics (e.g. metronidazole, neomycin) can help reduce the absorption of ammonia from the gastrointestinal tract. Enemas may also be used to clear the colon of ammonia-producing substances.

[3] Dietary management: Providing a protein-restricted, highly digestible diet can help minimize the production of ammonia. Supplementation with branched-chain amino acids may also be beneficial.

[4] Addressing underlying liver disease: If the hepatic encephalopathy is secondary to a primary liver condition, treating the underlying liver disease is crucial. This may involve medications, dietary changes, or in some cases, surgical intervention to address conditions like portosystemic shunts.

[5] Monitoring and supportive care: Close monitoring of the patient's neurological status, electrolytes, and other parameters is important. Medications to control seizures or reduce intracranial pressure may be necessary in severe cases.

The prognosis for pets with hepatic encephalopathy depends on the underlying cause and the severity of the condition. With prompt and appropriate treatment, many pets can recover and have a good quality of life, though some may experience recurrent episodes. Regular veterinary follow-up is essential to manage this condition effectively.

## Preventive Measures

Preventive measures that can be taken to manage hepatic encephalopathy include:

[1] Vaccination: Ensuring pets are up-to-date on all recommended vaccinations can help prevent infectious diseases that could exacerbate liver disease and contribute to hepatic encephalopathy.

[2] Environmental management: Providing a stress-free, calm environment for pets with liver disease can help reduce the risk of precipitating factors that could trigger hepatic encephalopathy episodes. This includes minimizing loud noises, changes in routine, and other sources of stress.

[3] Dietary management: Feeding a protein-restricted, highly digestible diet can help reduce the production and absorption of ammonia and other toxins that accumulate in liver disease. Specific dietary recommendations should be made by a veterinarian based on the individual pet's needs.

[4] Medication management: Some medications, such as benzodiazepines, antibiotics, and diuretics, can exacerbate hepatic encephalopathy. Careful monitoring and adjusting medications as needed is important.

[5] Treating underlying liver disease: Identifying and treating the underlying cause of liver disease, such as portosystemic shunts, can help prevent the development of chronic hepatic encephalopathy.

[6] Monitoring and managing precipitating factors: Being vigilant for factors that can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy episodes, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, constipation, infections, and dietary indiscretions, and promptly addressing them.

By implementing these preventive measures, the risk and severity of hepatic encephalopathy can be reduced in pets with liver disease.

## Differential Diagnosis

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neurological condition that can occur in pets, more commonly in dogs, that already have liver disease. The condition is most frequently associated with portosystemic shunts, which prevent blood from being properly filtered by the liver. However, HE can also occur in other hepatic disorders that lead to end-stage liver failure.

Differentiating HE from other potential causes of encephalopathy is important. Some key points in the differential diagnosis include:

- Ammonia is the most commonly cited cause of HE, but other metabolites such as mercaptan, amino acid imbalances, and GABA-benzodiazepine receptor abnormalities may also contribute. [1]

- HE must be distinguished from other known brain diseases through exclusion of other causes. There is no definitive diagnostic test, so diagnosis relies on clinical signs, laboratory findings, imaging, and response to treatment. [1]

- HE is most frequently associated with portosystemic shunts in dogs and cats, but may also occur in other hepatic disorders that lead to end-stage liver failure. [1]

- Other potential causes of encephalopathy that should be considered include thiamine deficiency, severe hypophosphatemia or hyponatremia, drug-induced neurological complications, and non-hepatic conditions like meningoencephalitis. [5]

- In acute HE, there is risk of cerebral edema and brain herniation that must be addressed. This differentiates it from chronic intermittent HE. [5]

In summary, while HE is a common cause of encephalopathy in pets with liver disease, particularly those with portosystemic shunts, it is important to thoroughly investigate and rule out other potential neurological disorders. The diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical signs, laboratory tests, imaging, and therapeutic response.
