## Disease Overview

Mesenteric torsion, also known as mesenteric volvulus, is a rare but serious condition in dogs where the intestines twist around the root of the mesentery. This leads to obstruction of the cranial mesenteric vessels and branches, resulting in vascular compromise, intestinal ischemia, and circulatory shock.[1] The condition is most commonly reported in adult, large-breed dogs, particularly German Shepherd Dogs.[2,3] 

Epidemiological studies have identified several risk factors for mesenteric torsion, including increasing age, history of gastrointestinal disease, prior abdominal surgery, and prophylactic gastropexy.[4,5] The condition is rapidly progressive and often fatal, with mortality rates ranging from 58-100% despite early detection and aggressive treatment.[2] Immediate surgical intervention to reduce the torsion is crucial, but the prognosis remains grave.

## Pathogenic Causes

Mesenteric torsion is a rare but serious condition in dogs that can have several potential causes. While the exact etiology is not fully understood, some common factors that may contribute to mesenteric torsion include:

1. Breed predisposition: Certain large and giant breed dogs, such as German Shepherds and Pointers, appear to be more prone to developing mesenteric torsion.[1,2] The underlying reasons for this breed association are not clear.

2. Previous abdominal surgery: Dogs with a history of prior abdominal surgeries, including gastropexy procedures, may be at increased risk of developing mesenteric torsion.[1,2] The relationship is not fully established, but changes to the normal abdominal anatomy may play a role.

3. Gastrointestinal disease history: A previous history of gastrointestinal disorders has been identified as a risk factor for mesenteric torsion in some studies.[2] The underlying mechanisms are not well understood.

4. Increased age: Older dogs appear to be more susceptible to developing mesenteric torsion compared to younger animals.[2] Age-related changes in abdominal anatomy and mobility may contribute to this risk.

5. Congenital anatomical abnormalities: Inherent laxity or malformations of the mesenteric attachments may predispose some dogs to torsion, though this has not been extensively studied.[1]

While infectious agents are not considered a primary cause of mesenteric torsion, secondary bacterial infections can occur as a consequence of the bowel ischemia and necrosis that results from the torsion. Clostridium species have been reported in association with some cases of mesenteric torsion.[3]

In summary, the development of mesenteric torsion in dogs appears to be multifactorial, with breed predisposition, prior abdominal surgeries, gastrointestinal disease history, and increased age being the most commonly reported risk factors. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the underlying pathogenic mechanisms.

## Clinical Presentation

Mesenteric torsion in companion animals typically presents with sudden and severe clinical signs, including abdominal pain, vomiting (sometimes with blood), abdominal distension, and high-volume bloody diarrhea. [1,2] The rapid onset of these symptoms, along with lethargy, pale mucous membranes, rapid heart rate, and weak pulse, can rapidly lead to shock and death if not promptly addressed. [3] 

Radiographic findings often show severely dilated, gas-filled loops of small intestine lying parallel to each other, indicating volvulus. [1,2,4] Ultrasonography may reveal a "whirlpool sign" created by the malposition of the mesenteric artery and vein. [5] Clinicopathological abnormalities can include hypoalbuminemia, hypoproteinemia, and hypokalemia. [1,3]

## Diagnostic Methods

Mesenteric torsion in dogs and cats can be challenging to diagnose, but prompt imaging and surgical intervention are crucial for positive outcomes. Key diagnostic tests and procedures include:

Clinical Presentation: Patients typically present with acute abdominal pain, vomiting, lethargy, and anorexia. Affected animals may be in shock due to vascular compromise. [1,2]

Radiography: Radiographic findings commonly include moderate to severe dilation of the small intestines with fluid and gas. The location of the malpositioned pylorus and spleen can help differentiate mesenteric torsion from other causes of gastrointestinal obstruction. [2,3]

Ultrasonography: Ultrasound can identify a dilated, fluid-filled segment of small intestine, with thickened bowel walls and hyperechoic mesentery. Absent or reduced blood flow in the mesenteric vessels may also be seen. [4]

CT Imaging: When available, CT with contrast can clearly visualize the twisted mesentery and vascular compromise, aiding in diagnosis. [5]

Surgical Exploration: Definitive diagnosis requires surgical exploration and identification of the torsed segment of bowel. Prompt surgical correction is necessary to restore blood flow and prevent irreversible intestinal ischemia and necrosis. [1,2]

## Treatment Options

Mesenteric torsion is a life-threatening condition that requires rapid surgical intervention. The primary treatment is emergency exploratory laparotomy to correct the twisted intestines and restore blood flow [1]. Supportive care before surgery is also crucial, including intravenous fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, and pain management [2,3].

During surgery, the veterinarian will attempt to untwist the mesenteric root and intestines. If any portion of the intestine is necrotic, that section may need to be surgically removed [4]. After the torsion is corrected, the veterinarian will often perform additional procedures like a gastropexy to prevent future occurrences.

Postoperative care is critical and may involve continued fluid therapy, antibiotics, pain medication, and nutritional support [3,5]. Careful monitoring is required as patients can develop complications like shock, sepsis, and intestinal necrosis. Despite prompt surgical intervention, the prognosis for mesenteric torsion remains grave, with reported mortality rates as high as 60% [4].

## Prevention Strategies

Owners of dogs at high risk for mesenteric torsion, such as German Shepherds, should be proactive in taking steps to reduce the risk of this condition. Some key preventive measures include:

[1] Feeding multiple smaller meals per day rather than one large meal. This can help prevent rapid gastric distension that may contribute to torsion. [2,3]

[2] Avoiding strenuous exercise or activity immediately before and after feeding. This reduces the risk of the dog engaging in vigorous activity with a full stomach. [2,3]

[3] Considering prophylactic gastropexy surgery, especially in high-risk breeds. This procedure attaches the stomach to the body wall to prevent torsion. Studies have shown it can significantly reduce the risk of recurrence. [4,5]

[4] Managing stress and avoiding situations that may cause anxiety in the dog, as these have been identified as risk factors. [1,2]

[5] Not breeding dogs that have had a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, offspring) with a history of mesenteric torsion, as this increases the risk. [1]

Overall, proactive measures focused on feeding management, activity restriction, and prophylactic surgery in high-risk breeds can help reduce the incidence of this life-threatening condition in companion animals. Prompt veterinary care is also critical if signs of mesenteric torsion develop.

## Differential Diagnosis

Gastric dilation and volvulus (GDV) is a life-threatening condition that primarily affects large- and giant-breed dogs. Other diseases and conditions that can present with similar symptoms include:

[1] Splenic torsion: Isolated splenic torsion can cause severe enlargement of the spleen, leading to peripheral displacement of surrounding organs. Radiographic findings may include a "reverse C-shaped" spleen or the absence of the splenic head on ventrodorsal views.

[2] Colonic torsion: Also known as colonic volvulus, this condition involves the twisting of the descending colon around its long axis. Radiographic findings include segmental gaseous dilation of the colon with focal narrowing and abnormal displacement of the descending colon and cecum.

[3] Mesenteric volvulus: This rare condition involves the twisting of the small bowel around the root of the mesentery, causing complete occlusion of the cranial mesenteric artery. Radiographic features include moderate to severe dilation of most of the small bowel with gas and fluid.

To differentiate these conditions, veterinarians will rely on a combination of the patient's history, physical examination findings, and diagnostic imaging. Radiographs are typically the initial imaging modality, but additional tests such as ultrasound or computed tomography may be necessary in some cases to confirm the diagnosis.

# Pet Disease: Mesenteric Torsion

Mesenteric torsion is a rare but serious condition in dogs that involves the intestines twisting around the root of the mesentery. This rapidly progressive disorder can lead to life-threatening vascular compromise and intestinal ischemia. While the exact causes are not fully understood, breed predisposition, prior abdominal surgeries, and gastrointestinal disease history have been identified as key risk factors. Prompt surgical intervention is crucial, but the prognosis remains grave, with mortality rates as high as 60% despite aggressive treatment.

## Conclusion

Mesenteric torsion is a complex and challenging condition that requires vigilance from both veterinarians and pet owners. Preventive measures like feeding management, activity restriction, and prophylactic gastropexy in high-risk breeds can help reduce the risk. However, rapid recognition of clinical signs and immediate surgical intervention are essential for survival. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms and improve treatment outcomes for this devastating disorder.
