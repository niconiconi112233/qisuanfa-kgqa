## Disease Overview

Giardiasis is an intestinal infection caused by the protozoan parasite Giardia duodenalis (also known as G. intestinalis or G. lamblia). This parasite infects a wide range of mammalian hosts, including dogs, cats, livestock, and humans [1,2]. 

Molecular analysis has identified several distinct genetic assemblages (A-H) of G. duodenalis, some of which have broader host ranges while others are more host-specific [3]. Assemblages A and B are the most common in humans, while dogs are primarily infected with assemblages C and D, and cats with assemblage F [3,4].

Prevalence rates of Giardia infection in dogs and cats are reported to be around 10-30%, with higher rates in younger animals [2,4]. However, many infected animals may be asymptomatic and continually shed cysts, complicating treatment and control [3,5]. Giardiasis in animals is associated with gastrointestinal signs such as chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea, and weight loss, although subclinical infections are common [4,5].

## Common Pathogens

Giardiasis is an intestinal infection caused by the parasitic protozoan *Giardia*. There are several species of *Giardia* that can infect pets, but the most common is *G. duodenalis*, which has a wide host range including dogs, cats, and humans.[1] 

Different genotypes or assemblages of *G. duodenalis* tend to infect specific host species. For example, assemblages C and D primarily infect dogs, while assemblage F infects cats.[2] Transmission typically occurs through ingestion of *Giardia* cysts present in contaminated food, water, or soil.[1] 

Infection can cause symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and weight loss, though some infected animals may show no clinical signs.[2] Diagnosis is typically made by detecting cysts or antigens in fecal samples. Treatment often involves anti-parasitic medications like fenbendazole or metronidazole, along with thorough environmental cleaning.[3]

While zoonotic transmission between pets and humans is possible, it is generally rare, as the *Giardia* assemblages that infect dogs and cats are typically different from those that infect humans.[1] Nonetheless, good hygiene practices like handwashing after handling pets or cleaning up their waste are important to prevent potential spread.[3]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Giardiasis can cause a range of clinical symptoms in dogs and cats, though many infections are asymptomatic. The most common clinical signs include:

[1] Chronic or intermittent diarrhea, often with a soft, fatty, and foul-smelling consistency. The stool may also contain mucus. [1,2]

[2] Abdominal discomfort or pain. Infected animals may exhibit lethargy, decreased appetite, and weight loss in severe cases. [1,2]

[3] Unlike dogs, giardiasis in cats is more often associated with watery diarrhea rather than soft, fatty stools. Vomiting is also less common in cats compared to dogs. [4]

[4] Gross intestinal lesions are typically not evident, though microscopic changes like villous atrophy and cuboidal enterocytes may be present. [3]

Overall, the clinical presentation can vary widely, from asymptomatic infection to severe diarrhea and malabsorption. Factors like the host's age, immune status, and infecting Giardia assemblage can influence the severity of symptoms. [1,2]

Here is a draft section on the diagnostic methods for giardiasis:

## Diagnostic Methods

The infection is diagnosed using direct examination of faecal smears (wet mount examination), faecal flotation methods, faecal ELISA antigen assays, direct immunofluorescence on faecal smears and PCR.

Trophozoites can be identified in fresh faecal smears. They are motile with a rolling action. A small amount of freshly passed faeces or mucus is mixed with a drop of saline solution on a microscope slide, covered with a coverslip and immediately examined under a microscope at a magnification of x100. Further examination at x400 allows definitive identification. It is also possible to use microscopic examination of duodenal aspirates collected during endoscopic small intestinal intubation for trophozoites. However, *Giardia* resides further down the small intestine of cats beyond the reach of endoscopic intubation.

A zinc sulphate flotation method is recommended for faecal screening. Routine saturated salt or sucrose methods are unsatisfactory since they lead to distortion of the cysts. Excretion of cysts is erratic and therefore several (usually three) faecal samples collected on consecutive or alternative days should be screened.

It is also possible to use a direct fluorescent antibody technique to detect cysts in faecal smears, a test not widely used in Europe.

ELISA techniques for detecting *Giardia* antigen in faeces are available and investigations suggested that the ELISA tests now used are more sensitive than microscopy. However, it was suggested previously that ELISA tests are not more sensitive than careful faecal screening, and several studies confirmed that ELISA and IFA performed better than microscopy. Studies have shown that ELISA detection of antigen correlates well with direct fluorescent antibody screening results.

PCR tests are available and are used for routine diagnostics. They have the advantage of being able to identify the subtype present. The first PCR-based studies displayed a high proportion of positives (up to 80% versus 60% for ELISA and 5% for microscopy), which raised concerns that they might detect infections that are not clinically relevant. More studies have demonstrated the high sensitivity and specificity of PCR. Moreover, real-time PCR assays are now available for *Giardia* detection and several studies showed similar prevalence rates when real-time PCR was compared to other techniques.

The faecal flotation method was the standard test used in the past, but the in-practice ELISA faecal antigen test appears to be equally sensitive and specific and is convenient to perform. Point of Care immunochromatography tests are also available and were demonstrated more sensitive than microscopy. Examination of faecal smears is cheap and has the advantage of identifying other potential parasites – but it is not popular in practice and is less sensitive.

A pragmatic approach often used by practitioners as an alternative to testing is to assess the response to treatment. This should be avoided because of the risk of altering the gut flora with antibiotics. Moreover, co-infections with other parasites like *Tritrichomonas foetus* or *Cryptosporidium* are frequent and the treatment, if necessary, should be adapted to the results of analyses.

## Treatment Options

The standard treatment of Giardia infection has generally been an imidazole, usually fenbendazole given at 50 mg/kg/day for 5-7 days [1]. Fenbendazole may be used in pregnant queens. Metronidazole is an alternative, and the original recommendation was to use it at a dosage of 50 mg/kg/day for five days but should not be used in pregnant queens [1]. This dosage carries an increased risk of side effects – central nervous toxicity causing weakness, ataxia, disorientation and seizures. It has been suggested that treatment during 7 days with a daily dosage of 25 mg/kg is effective, which is unlikely to induce side effects [2].

Another alternative treatment is use of ronidazole which has been proved as efficient against Giardiasis in dogs [3] and in cats [4]. Ronidazole is also currently used as treatment of infection with Tritrichomonas foetus in cats.

Use of a single dose of 50 mg/kg PO of nitazoxanide has been proposed as an alternative for treatment in dogs and shows an efficacy equivalent to 3 doses of fenbendazole [5].

It is not recommended to treat an asymptomatic cat, but in multi-cat environments where cats with clinical signs are present, it may be more efficient to treat all animals (dogs and cats) living together [6]. Moreover, positive cats living in contact with immunocompromised people should be treated.

## Preventive Measures

To prevent giardiasis, several key strategies can be implemented:

[1] Vaccination: Unfortunately, a commercial vaccine for giardiasis in cats and dogs is not currently available.[2] Isolation: Infected animals should be kept separate from healthy animals to prevent transmission. Proper disinfection of the environment is crucial.[3]

Environmental management: Thorough cleaning and disinfection of the animal's living space is essential. This includes promptly removing and properly disposing of feces, washing bedding, and disinfecting surfaces with quaternary ammonium compounds or chlorine-based products.[4,5] Reducing environmental contamination is key, as Giardia cysts can persist for months in the right conditions.

Regular bathing of infected animals can also help remove Giardia cysts from the fur and reduce the risk of self-infection or transmission to other pets. Clipping the hair around the tail and hindquarters may facilitate keeping this area clean.[5] 

Testing new animals entering a multi-pet household during a quarantine period can help prevent the introduction of Giardia. Proper hygiene, such as handwashing after handling infected animals or their feces, is also important to reduce the zoonotic risk.

## Differential Diagnosis

Giardiasis in cats can present with similar symptoms as other gastrointestinal disorders, so it is important to consider the differential diagnosis. Some key considerations include:

[1] Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Like giardiasis, IBD can cause chronic, intermittent diarrhea and weight loss in cats. However, IBD is more often associated with vomiting and abdominal pain, and has a different underlying cause. [1]

[2] Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: This condition leads to maldigestion and malabsorption, resulting in steatorrhea and weight loss, similar to giardiasis. Definitive diagnosis involves testing pancreatic enzyme levels. [2]

[3] Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO): SIBO can also cause chronic diarrhea and malabsorption in cats. It is differentiated from giardiasis by the lack of cysts/antigens in the stool. [3]

[4] Intestinal parasites: Other intestinal parasites like roundworms, hookworms, and coccidiosis can produce diarrhea, but would be identified through fecal examination. [4]

[5] Dietary intolerance or food allergy: These conditions may cause chronic gastrointestinal signs, but would not involve detection of Giardia organisms. [5]

Careful history-taking, physical exam, and appropriate diagnostic testing (fecal flotation, antigen testing, etc.) are key to differentiating giardiasis from these other potential causes of chronic diarrhea in cats.

Giardiasis is a widespread intestinal infection caused by the Giardia parasite, which can affect a variety of mammalian hosts including dogs, cats, and humans. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the disease, covering its epidemiology, common pathogens, clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods, treatment options, and preventive measures. Key insights include the prevalence of asymptomatic infections, the role of different Giardia assemblages in host specificity, and the importance of thorough environmental disinfection in managing outbreaks. With a focus on practical guidance for veterinary professionals, this report equips readers with the knowledge to effectively diagnose, treat, and prevent giardiasis in companion animals.

## Conclusion

Giardiasis is a complex parasitic disease that requires a multifaceted approach for effective management in pets. The report highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis through a combination of laboratory testing and clinical observation, as well as the need for targeted treatment protocols and rigorous environmental control measures. While zoonotic transmission is possible, the report emphasizes that the Giardia assemblages infecting pets are typically distinct from those that affect humans. Moving forward, continued research into the epidemiology and host-specificity of Giardia is crucial to develop more robust prevention and control strategies for this ubiquitous parasite.
