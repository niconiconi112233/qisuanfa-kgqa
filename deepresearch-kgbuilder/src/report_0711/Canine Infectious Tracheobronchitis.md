## Disease Overview

Canine infectious tracheobronchitis, also commonly known as "kennel cough" or canine cough, is a highly contagious upper respiratory disease affecting dogs [1]. The disease is caused by a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens, most commonly the canine parainfluenza virus and Bordetella bronchiseptica bacteria [1,2]. 

Kennel cough is primarily spread through direct contact with infected dogs or exposure to contaminated objects and environments, such as kennels, shelters, or dog parks [1]. The disease is characterized by a harsh, dry cough that can sound like a "goose honk" and may be accompanied by other symptoms like sneezing, nasal discharge, and decreased appetite [1,2]. 

While kennel cough is usually a mild, self-limiting illness, it can progress to more serious complications like pneumonia, especially in young puppies, elderly dogs, or those with weakened immune systems [1,2]. Vaccination is an important preventive measure, as standard canine vaccines are effective against some of the major causative agents [1].

## Common Pathogens

The main causes of kennel cough are the Bordetella bronchiseptica bacteria and canine parainfluenza virus.[1] Other viruses that can contribute to kennel cough include canine adenovirus 2, canine influenza virus, and less commonly canine distemper virus.[2,3] Co-infections with multiple pathogens, such as Bordetella, parainfluenza, and adenovirus, are also common.[3]

Some additional bacteria and viruses that have been associated with kennel cough include Mycoplasma species, canine coronavirus, and canine reoviruses, though their exact role is not as well established.[3] Stress and environmental factors like temperature and humidity extremes can also increase susceptibility and severity of the disease.[3]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

The primary symptom of kennel cough is a non-productive (dry) persistent cough that can sound similar to a goose honk or like the dog has something stuck in their throat. [1] Other common signs include runny nose, sneezing, lack of energy, decreased appetite, and mild fever. [1] In more severe cases, dogs may develop a productive cough, lethargy, fever, and rapid or labored breathing, which can indicate a secondary bacterial pneumonia. [4] 

The cough typically worsens with activity or exercise, as the irritation to the airways is exacerbated. [4] While most dogs with kennel cough will recover within 7-10 days, puppies, senior dogs, and those with weakened immune systems are at greater risk of developing more severe illness. [1,4]

## Diagnostic Methods

Kennel cough, or canine infectious tracheobronchitis, is a highly contagious respiratory disease in dogs. The clinical presentation typically includes a sudden onset, rapid spread within a group, and a characteristic "honking" cough that may be accompanied by retching, sneezing, and nasal/eye discharge. [1] 

Diagnosis is often made presumptively based on the history and clinical signs. Thoracic radiographs may be normal in dogs with only a cough, but can reveal evidence of pneumonia if the infection has progressed. [2,6] 

Additional diagnostic testing may be recommended, especially in outbreaks or severe cases. This can include:

- Nasal or tracheal swabs for PCR testing to detect the causative viruses and bacteria, such as canine parainfluenza virus, canine adenovirus, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. [3,9-11] 
- Culture of respiratory samples to identify the specific pathogens involved. [6]
- Bronchoalveolar lavage or transtracheal wash to collect samples from the lower respiratory tract. [6]

Rapid, sensitive molecular diagnostics like PCR are the preferred methods for identifying the underlying infectious agents. [3,9-11] This allows veterinarians to confirm the diagnosis, determine the specific causative organisms, and guide appropriate treatment.

## Treatment Options

Kennel cough is typically treated with supportive care, though antibiotics may be prescribed in some cases. The key treatment approaches include:

[1] Cough suppression: Cough suppressants like hydrocodone or butorphanol can be used to control persistent, nonproductive coughing. This helps the dog rest and recover.

[2] Antibiotics: Antibiotics like doxycycline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or fluoroquinolones may be prescribed if there are signs of secondary bacterial infection, such as lethargy, fever, or purulent nasal discharge. The antibiotic choice is often based on culture and sensitivity testing.

[3] Nursing care: Ensuring the dog rests, providing a humidified environment, and monitoring food/water intake are important supportive measures. Probiotics may also be helpful.

[4] Isolation: Dogs with kennel cough should be kept away from other dogs to prevent spread of the infection. They should not be boarded or taken to places with high dog traffic until fully recovered.

[5] Vaccination: For prevention, dogs should be vaccinated against the common kennel cough pathogens like Bordetella, parainfluenza, and adenovirus. Vaccination helps reduce the severity of illness if infection does occur.

In summary, the main treatment involves cough suppression, antibiotics if indicated, supportive nursing care, and isolation to prevent spread - along with vaccination to reduce the risk of infection in the first place.

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is an important preventive measure against kennel cough in dogs. The Bordetella vaccine, administered as a nasal spray, can significantly reduce the risk and severity of the disease.[1] This vaccine is recommended for dogs that are at higher risk of exposure, such as those that board at kennels or frequently interact with other dogs.[2] 

In addition to vaccination, environmental management strategies can help control the spread of kennel cough. Isolating infected dogs, encouraging rest, and avoiding activities that can irritate the airways can all help mitigate the progression of the disease.[3] Proper disinfection of shared items and surfaces is also crucial, as the causative organisms can survive in the environment for some time.[3]

While vaccination does not guarantee complete protection, it is an effective tool in the prevention of kennel cough. Combined with responsible practices in multiple-dog settings, these measures can significantly reduce the risk of this highly contagious respiratory illness.

## Differential Diagnosis

Canine infectious tracheobronchitis, also known as "kennel cough," can have similar symptoms to other respiratory diseases that must be ruled out. Some key differential diagnoses include:

[1] Viral infections, such as canine distemper virus or canine influenza virus, which can cause more severe illness and pneumonia, especially in puppies or older/debilitated dogs. [2]

Bacterial infections, including those caused by Mycoplasma species, which can also lead to pneumonia. [3] 

Underlying chronic conditions like heart or lung disease, which may predispose dogs to respiratory infections. [2]

Exposure to irritants like smoke or chemicals, which can also cause tracheobronchitis. [2]

A thorough physical exam, medical history, and potentially diagnostic tests like radiographs or laboratory analysis will help the veterinarian distinguish kennel cough from these other potential causes of coughing and respiratory distress in dogs. [2]

# Canine Infectious Tracheobronchitis (Kennel Cough)

Canine infectious tracheobronchitis, commonly known as "kennel cough," is a highly contagious respiratory disease affecting dogs. This report examines the key pathogens, clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and preventive strategies for this common canine illness.

## Summary

Kennel cough is primarily caused by the Bordetella bronchiseptica bacteria and canine parainfluenza virus, though other viruses like adenovirus and influenza can also contribute. The characteristic dry, hacking cough is often accompanied by nasal discharge, lethargy, and decreased appetite. While diagnosis is usually made based on clinical signs, laboratory testing like PCR can identify the specific causative agents.

Treatment focuses on cough suppression, antibiotics if secondary infections develop, and supportive nursing care. Vaccination against the common kennel cough pathogens is crucial for prevention, particularly for dogs at high risk of exposure. Environmental management through isolation, disinfection, and limiting activities that can irritate the airways can also help control the spread of this contagious respiratory illness.
