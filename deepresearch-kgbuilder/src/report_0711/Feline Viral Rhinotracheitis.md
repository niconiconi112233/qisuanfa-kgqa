## Disease Overview

Feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR), also known as feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1), is a highly contagious respiratory disease that affects cats. It is a common and widespread condition, accounting for the majority of acute upper respiratory infections in cats. 

The disease is caused by the feline herpesvirus and primarily affects the nasal cavity, eyes, and trachea. Cats can become infected through direct contact with infected cats or exposure to contaminated environments and objects. Once infected, the virus can remain dormant in the cat's body and reactivate during times of stress, leading to recurring illness.

Epidemiological studies have found the prevalence of FVR to be highly variable, ranging from 20% to 50% in different cat populations [1,2,6]. Feline calicivirus, another common upper respiratory pathogen, has a similarly variable prevalence, ranging from 10% to 50% [2,6]. Together, these two viruses account for up to 80% of all feline upper respiratory tract infections [1].

Young kittens and immunocompromised cats are at the highest risk for developing severe disease. In these cases, FVR can lead to secondary bacterial infections, pneumonia, and other complications. Outbreaks are common in catteries, shelters, and other communal cat environments where the virus can spread easily between cats.

## Common Pathogens

The main viral and bacterial causes of feline viral rhinotracheitis are:

[1] Feline herpesvirus 1 (FeHV-1) is the primary causative agent, accounting for up to 80% of feline upper respiratory infections. FeHV-1 primarily infects the upper respiratory tract and eyes, causing rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and corneal ulcers. It can also lead to secondary bacterial infections and pneumonia.

[2] Feline calicivirus (FCV) is another important pathogen that can cause upper respiratory symptoms, oral ulcers, and viral pneumonia in cats. FCV and FeHV-1 account for the majority (80%) of feline respiratory disease cases.

[3] Chlamydia felis and Chlamydia psittaci can also contribute to feline respiratory infections, primarily causing conjunctivitis and rhinitis, though they are less important than FeHV-1 and FCV.  

[4] Mycoplasma species can lead to conjunctivitis and rhinitis in cats, but are less significant causes of disease compared to the viral agents.

[5] Feline infectious peritonitis virus may sometimes cause mild upper respiratory signs, but more typically leads to a systemic illness.

[6] Reoviruses can replicate in the respiratory tract but may not always cause overt respiratory disease.

In summary, the two most important pathogens causing feline viral rhinotracheitis are FeHV-1 and FCV, which account for the majority of cases. Secondary bacterial infections can also contribute to the severity of disease.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) caused by feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) is a common and highly contagious respiratory disease in cats. The typical clinical presentation includes fever, frequent sneezing, inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis), inflammation of the nasal lining (rhinitis), and often excessive salivation. [1][2] 

In the initial stage of infection, cats develop a clear nasal and ocular discharge, which soon becomes mucus-filled and purulent. [1][2] Excitement or movement may trigger sneezing episodes. The fever can reach up to 105°F (40.5°C) but is intermittent, coming and going. [1] 

As the disease progresses, cats become depressed and lose their appetite. Severe cases may develop mouth inflammation with sores, as well as corneal inflammation and ulceration. [1][2] The respiratory signs can persist for 5-10 days in milder cases, but may last up to 6 weeks in more severe infections. [1] Prolonged illness can lead to severe weight loss. [1]

Secondary bacterial infections are common in cats already ill with FVR, potentially leading to chronic rhinitis, sinusitis, conjunctivitis, or bacterial pneumonia. [1][2] Even after the acute illness resolves, FHV-1 remains latent in the cat's body, with periodic viral reactivation and recurrence of clinical signs, especially during times of stress. [1][2]

## Diagnostic Methods

The key diagnostic tools and techniques used to confirm a diagnosis of feline viral rhinotracheitis include:

Clinical assessment: The veterinarian will look for typical signs of FVR infection, such as sneezing, nasal congestion, conjunctivitis, excessive eye and nasal discharge, fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite [1]. Corneal ulcers may also be present.

Laboratory testing: A definitive diagnosis is typically made through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of samples collected from the eyes, nose, or throat. This highly sensitive test can detect the presence of feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) DNA [3,5,26]. Virus isolation and antibody detection tests are less commonly used.

Imaging: Radiographs or CT scans of the nasal cavity and sinuses may be performed to look for evidence of inflammation or other abnormalities [20]. This can help differentiate FVR from other potential causes of upper respiratory signs.

In summary, a combination of clinical signs, PCR testing, and potentially advanced imaging techniques are used to diagnose feline viral rhinotracheitis in cats.

## Treatment Options

Feline viral rhinotracheitis has no curative treatment, but rather requires supportive and symptomatic care. Key treatment approaches include:

[1] Broad-spectrum antibiotics - These are used to prevent secondary bacterial infections that can occur, especially in severe cases. Common antibiotic choices include amoxicillin-clavulanate or doxycycline.

[2] Supportive care - This includes providing fluids, maintaining good nutrition through a highly palatable diet, and using humidification or nebulization to help with nasal and respiratory congestion. 

[3] Antiviral medications - While there are no medications that can cure the viral infection, topical antiviral drugs like cidofovir or trifluridine may be used to help treat acute ocular disease. Oral antiviral drugs like famciclovir can also be used to help reduce the severity and duration of clinical signs.

[4] L-lysine supplements - Some studies have shown that L-lysine may help reduce the severity of disease, though its effectiveness is debated. It is generally considered safe when administered as a bolus.

[5] Good nursing care - Cleaning nasal and ocular discharge, providing warmth and comfort, and reducing stress are all important supportive measures.

In severe cases, cats may require hospitalization for more intensive supportive care and treatment. However, the majority of cats with feline viral rhinotracheitis can be managed as outpatients with appropriate veterinary supervision and home care.

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is a crucial preventive measure against feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR). All cats should receive the FVRCP vaccine, which protects against FVR as well as feline calicivirus and panleukopenia.[1] Kittens should start the FVRCP vaccine series at 6-8 weeks of age, with boosters every 3-4 weeks until they are 16-20 weeks old.[2,3] Adult cats receiving the FVRCP vaccine for the first time should also get a series of 2 doses, 3-4 weeks apart.[3] 

After the initial series, cats typically receive FVRCP booster shots every 1-3 years, as recommended by their veterinarian.[3,4] Regular FVRCP boosters are important, as cats that have been infected with FVR will remain carriers of the virus for life and may experience recurrent infections.[1] Periodic intranasal FVR and calicivirus vaccine boosters, up to 2-3 times per year, may also help prevent reactivation of the virus and viral shedding in carrier cats.[1]

In addition to vaccination, good hygiene practices like proper cleaning and disinfection can help reduce the spread of FVR. The virus can survive on surfaces for up to a year, so even indoor cats are at risk if they briefly go outside.[3,4] Overall, a comprehensive preventive strategy involving vaccination and infection control is key to protecting cats from the potentially serious consequences of feline viral rhinotracheitis.

## Differential Diagnosis

Feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) caused by the feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) is one of the primary causes of upper respiratory infections in cats. However, it is important to consider other potential differential diagnoses that may present with similar clinical signs [1].

Feline calicivirus (FCV) is another common viral agent that can cause upper respiratory disease in cats. While FHV-1 generally triggers more severe signs, the clinical presentation of FVR and FCV can be difficult to distinguish [1]. Both viruses can lead to nasal congestion, ocular and nasal discharge, fever, and lethargy.

Additionally, infections with *Chlamydia felis* or *Mycoplasma* species can also result in conjunctivitis, sneezing, and ocular/nasal discharge, though these are typically less severe than infections with FHV-1 or FCV [2].

In some cases, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus may also present with mild upper respiratory signs, though the disease is usually characterized by more systemic illness [2]. Other rare viral causes of respiratory disease in cats include cowpox virus and influenza A [2].

It is important for veterinarians to obtain diagnostic samples, such as PCR tests, to definitively identify the underlying causative agent and guide appropriate treatment. This is especially important, as secondary bacterial infections with organisms like *Pasteurella multocida* or *Bordetella bronchiseptica* can complicate the clinical picture.

# Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis

Feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1). This common condition affects the nasal cavity, eyes, and trachea of cats, leading to symptoms like sneezing, nasal discharge, and conjunctivitis. FVR is a widespread problem, with prevalence ranging from 20-50% in different cat populations. Young kittens and immunocompromised felines are at highest risk for severe disease complications.

## Summary

Feline viral rhinotracheitis is primarily driven by FHV-1, though feline calicivirus (FCV) is another key pathogen responsible for upper respiratory infections in cats. Clinical signs include fever, sneezing, nasal/ocular discharge, lethargy, and potential secondary bacterial infections. Definitive diagnosis relies on PCR testing, with treatment focused on supportive care and prevention of complications. Vaccination with the FVRCP series is critical to protect cats, as infected animals can become lifelong carriers of the virus. Maintaining good hygiene and disinfection practices are also important preventive measures.
