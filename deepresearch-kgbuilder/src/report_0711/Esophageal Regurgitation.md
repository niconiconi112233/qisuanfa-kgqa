## Disease Overview

Esophageal regurgitation is a condition in pets where food or liquid comes back up the esophagus and out of the mouth without much effort. This is different from vomiting, which involves active contractions of the stomach and abdominal muscles. Regurgitation is often caused by disorders that affect the esophagus, such as [1]:

- Congenital abnormalities like megaesophagus (abnormal dilation of the esophagus) or vascular ring anomalies (abnormal blood vessels compressing the esophagus)
- Acquired conditions like myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus, nerve/muscle disorders, or esophageal obstructions/strictures
- Inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis) from acid reflux, foreign objects, or medications

Pets with regurgitation often show signs like suddenly bringing up undigested food, weight loss, difficulty swallowing, and aspiration pneumonia. Diagnosing the underlying cause may involve radiographs, contrast studies, or endoscopy [2,3].

Treatment focuses on managing the symptoms, such as feeding the pet in an elevated position, changing diet consistency, and addressing any underlying conditions. However, the long-term prognosis for pets with esophageal regurgitation is often guarded due to the risk of complications like aspiration pneumonia [1].

## Common Pathogens

Esophageal regurgitation in pets can be caused by a variety of viral, bacterial, and other known factors. Some of the common causes include:

[1] Viral infections: Calicivirus in cats has been reported to cause esophagitis and subsequent regurgitation.[1] 

[2] Bacterial infections: Esophageal regurgitation can occur secondary to bacterial overgrowth or aspiration pneumonia.[2]

[3] Parasitic infections: The parasitic nematode _Spirocerca lupi_ can cause esophageal inflammation and regurgitation in dogs.[1] 

[4] Structural abnormalities: Congenital defects like vascular ring anomalies or acquired conditions like hiatal hernias can lead to esophageal dysmotility and reflux.[3]

[5] Medications: Certain drugs like doxycycline, atropine, and acepromazine that affect esophageal motility or lower esophageal sphincter tone can predispose animals to regurgitation.[1,2]

[6] Dietary factors: Rapid eating, overeating, and diets high in fat or fiber may contribute to esophageal regurgitation in some pets.[1]

In summary, the common causes of esophageal regurgitation span viral, bacterial, parasitic, structural, and dietary factors, highlighting the importance of a thorough diagnostic workup to determine the underlying etiology.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Esophageal regurgitation in dogs is associated with a variety of clinical signs, including:

- Drooling more than usual [1]
- Wheezing [1] 
- Regurgitation or vomiting [1]
- Burping or gurgling after eating [1]
- Bad smelling breath [1]
- Coughing up small amounts of vomit [1]
- Pain [1]

The key difference between regurgitation and vomiting is that regurgitation is a passive process, where the dog simply opens its mouth and undigested material comes out, without the active abdominal contractions seen in vomiting. [2]

## Diagnostic Methods

Identifying and evaluating esophageal regurgitation involves a thorough diagnostic approach. The key elements include:

Clinical Presentation: Careful history-taking is crucial to differentiate regurgitation from vomiting. Regurgitation is the passive expulsion of food or fluid from the esophagus, while vomiting involves active contractions of the stomach and abdominal muscles. Owners should be questioned about the timing, frequency, and nature of the episodes to help narrow the differential diagnoses. [1,2]

Laboratory Testing: Initial diagnostic tests should include a complete blood count, serum biochemistry panel, and urinalysis. These can help rule out systemic or metabolic diseases that may secondarily affect esophageal function. [1]

Imaging: Plain and contrast radiographs are the next important step. They can reveal esophageal dilation, foreign bodies, strictures, hiatal hernias, and other structural abnormalities. Fluoroscopy may be used to assess esophageal motility. [2,3]

Endoscopy: Esophagoscopy is the most definitive diagnostic tool. It allows direct visualization of the esophageal mucosa and can identify intraluminal lesions such as inflammation, strictures, or neoplasia. Biopsies can also be obtained. [3,4]

In summary, a combination of a thorough history, laboratory testing, imaging, and endoscopic evaluation is typically required to thoroughly diagnose and characterize the underlying cause of esophageal regurgitation in dogs and cats.

## Treatment Options

Esophageal regurgitation can be managed through both medical and supportive care approaches. The primary goals of treatment are to reduce gastric acidity, improve esophageal motility, and provide pain relief.

Medical treatment often involves the use of proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, to decrease gastric acid production.[1] Prokinetic drugs like cisapride and metoclopramide can help improve esophageal motility and reduce reflux.[1] In severe cases, a gastrostomy tube may be placed to bypass the esophagus and allow the esophageal inflammation to heal.[1]

Supportive care is also essential and includes feeding small, frequent meals of a soft, low-fat, and low-fiber diet to minimize esophageal irritation.[1] Elevating the front of the animal's food and water bowls can also help reduce reflux.[2] If aspiration pneumonia develops, broad-spectrum antibiotics may be necessary.[1]

In cases where an underlying cause, such as a foreign body or vascular ring anomaly, is identified, surgical intervention may be required to correct the problem and prevent further esophageal damage.[2,3]

## Preventive Measures

To avoid or minimize esophageal regurgitation, some key preventive steps can be taken:

Start feeding your dog smaller, more frequent meals. This puts less pressure on the esophagus and stomach, increasing the chances of food moving properly down the digestive tract [1]. Additionally, keeping your dog in an upright position for 15-20 minutes after eating allows gravity to help the food move down the esophagus [4]. 

For dogs prone to issues like megaesophagus or other esophageal disorders, your veterinarian may recommend a specialized, soft diet or feeding from an elevated platform to further facilitate proper digestion [4]. In some cases, medications to reduce stomach acid or relax the esophageal sphincter may also be prescribed as a preventive measure [2].

Finally, being vigilant for signs of regurgitation and addressing any underlying causes promptly can help avoid the development of more serious complications like aspiration pneumonia [3].

## Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for esophageal regurgitation includes several other conditions that can present with similar symptoms:

[1] Esophageal stricture (if located near the lower esophageal sphincter) can cause partial obstruction and lead to regurgitation. This may occur after esophageal injury, inflammation, or surgical procedures. [2]

Certain neuromuscular disorders like myasthenia gravis, hypoadrenocorticism, lead poisoning, botulism, and tetanus can also cause esophageal dysmotility and regurgitation. [3]

Hypothyroidism and polyradiculitis may additionally contribute to esophageal dysfunction and regurgitation. [3]

Structural esophageal diseases like foreign bodies, tumors, diverticula, and granulomas should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. [4]

# Pet Disease: Esophageal Regurgitation

Esophageal regurgitation is a concerning condition where pets involuntarily bring up undigested food or liquid from the esophagus. This passive process differs from active vomiting and can lead to serious complications like aspiration pneumonia if left untreated. By understanding the common causes, diagnostic approaches, and treatment options for esophageal regurgitation, veterinary professionals can provide effective care for affected pets.

## Summary

Esophageal regurgitation in pets has a diverse range of underlying causes, from viral infections and structural abnormalities to certain medications and dietary factors. Careful diagnosis through history-taking, laboratory testing, imaging, and endoscopy is crucial to identify the root issue. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms, reducing gastric acidity, and improving esophageal motility, with supportive care playing a key role. By taking preventive measures like smaller, elevated meals, veterinarians can help minimize the risk of regurgitation and associated complications. Though the long-term prognosis is often guarded, a thorough, multifaceted approach can significantly improve outcomes for pets suffering from this condition.
