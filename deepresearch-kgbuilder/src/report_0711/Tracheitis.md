## Disease Overview

Tracheitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the trachea, or windpipe. It can occur in both dogs and cats, often as part of an infectious respiratory disease complex.

The most common causes of tracheitis include:

[1] Infectious agents like viruses (e.g. canine parainfluenza virus, canine adenovirus) and bacteria (e.g. Bordetella bronchiseptica). These infectious agents can directly infect and inflame the trachea, or cause secondary inflammation. [2]

[2] Irritants like excessive barking, smoke inhalation, or exposure to chemicals. This can lead to tracheal irritation and inflammation. [1]

The main symptoms of tracheitis include a harsh, dry cough that is often worsened by excitement, exercise, or drinking water. Affected animals may also have nasal discharge, lethargy, and fever in some cases. [1,2]

Diagnosis typically involves ruling out other causes of coughing through history, physical exam, and potentially diagnostic tests like x-rays or bronchoscopy. Treatment often involves rest, cough suppressants, antibiotics if a bacterial infection is suspected, and addressing any underlying causes. [1,2,14]

While tracheitis is usually self-limiting, it can progress to more serious complications like bronchitis or pneumonia in some cases. Proper management is important to prevent worsening of symptoms and damage to the airways. [1,2]

## Common Pathogens

Tracheitis in companion animals can be caused by a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens. The most common causes are viral infections, such as canine adenovirus type 2 and canine parainfluenza virus, which can damage the respiratory epithelium and allow secondary bacterial infections [1]. Other viruses like canine adenovirus types 1 and 3, and canine herpesvirus, have also been implicated [1]. 

Bacterial infections, especially with Bordetella bronchiseptica, frequently accompany viral tracheobronchitis and can lead to more severe manifestations like bronchopneumonia [1]. In cats, herpesvirus and calicivirus can affect the laryngeal mucosa and cause tracheitis [1].

While viral tracheitis typically presents with a dry, harsh cough, the development of a productive cough indicates the involvement of the lower respiratory tract and possible secondary bacterial infection [1]. Palpation of the trachea often elicits coughing in these cases [1].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Tracheitis is an inflammation of the trachea that can occur in both dogs and cats. The most prominent symptom is a hard, dry cough that can be triggered by palpation of the trachea [1]. This cough is often nonproductive, meaning there is little to no mucus or phlegm expelled. In some cases, the cough may be severe enough to cause gagging or retching [1,5]. 

Other clinical signs of tracheitis include sensitivity of the trachea to palpation, which can elicit the dry cough, as well as lethargy and lack of appetite in some animals [1,5]. Fever is typically absent unless there is a secondary bacterial infection present [1]. In severe cases, difficulty breathing may occur if the inflammation and swelling of the trachea significantly obstructs airflow [3].

The diagnosis of tracheitis is based on the characteristic clinical signs, as well as ruling out other potential causes of coughing through diagnostic tests such as chest radiographs and bronchoscopy [1,5]. Identifying the underlying cause, whether infectious or related to an underlying condition, is also an important part of the diagnostic process.

## Diagnostic Methods

Respiratory endoscopy is a valuable diagnostic tool for evaluating upper and lower airway conditions in dogs and cats. It allows veterinarians to visually inspect the nasal passages, larynx, trachea, and bronchi.

Rhinoscopy involves examining the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, and paranasal sinuses. It can help identify abnormalities such as mucosal inflammation, polyps, tumors, or foreign bodies. Samples can also be collected for biopsy or culture.

Laryngoscopy allows assessment of the larynx, including anatomy and vocal cord function. Common findings include laryngeal paralysis, edema, or masses. Respiratory stimulants may be used to better evaluate laryngeal motion.

Bronchoscopy provides a detailed view of the lower airways, including the trachea, carina, and bronchi. It can identify airway compression, collapse, or secretions. Bronchoalveolar lavage can be performed to collect samples for cytology and culture.

These endoscopic techniques require general anesthesia and specialized equipment. Proper anesthetic management and endoscopic technique are critical to safely perform these procedures and obtain diagnostic information. [1,2,5]

## Treatment Options

Tracheitis, the inflammation of the trachea, can be managed through a combination of medical and supportive care approaches. 

For mild cases or those with recent onset, supportive therapy may be effective. This includes providing extra water intake, using cough syrups, and allowing the dog to rest [1]. Corticosteroids are often used to decrease airway inflammation in dogs with chronic bronchitis [2]. 

If a bacterial infection is present, antibiotics may be prescribed. A persistent, dry cough may be controlled with a cough suppressant containing codeine [2]. The veterinarian may also recommend therapy such as nebulization or steam from a hot shower to help loosen secretions and stimulate coughing [2].

For severe or chronic cases, more intensive treatment may be required. This could include the use of bronchodilators, sedatives, or anti-anxiety medications [1,2]. Addressing any underlying health conditions, such as obesity or heart disease, is also important [1,4].

In some cases, surgical intervention with tracheal stenting may be considered if the dog does not respond to medical management or experiences respiratory emergencies [5]. However, this procedure carries risks and ongoing medical care is still required [5].

With proper treatment, the prognosis for dogs with tracheitis is generally good, especially for milder cases. However, the condition can be progressive, and some dogs may continue to have ongoing symptoms throughout their lives [5].

## Preventive Measures

To help prevent tracheitis in dogs, there are several key preventive measures to consider:

Vaccination: Vaccines are available to protect against some of the main pathogens responsible for kennel cough, such as canine distemper virus, parainfluenza virus, and Bordetella bronchiseptica.[1] Consulting with your veterinarian about the appropriate vaccination schedule for your dog is recommended.

Reducing Environmental Stressors: Tracheitis can be exacerbated by environmental factors like extreme temperatures, humidity, and poor ventilation.[2] Avoiding these triggers and providing a comfortable, stress-free living environment for your dog can help reduce the risk of developing tracheitis.

Maintaining a Healthy Weight: Obesity has been identified as a risk factor for respiratory issues like tracheitis.[2] Keeping your dog at a healthy weight through proper diet and exercise can help prevent and manage tracheitis.

Avoiding Neck Collars: Using a harness instead of a neck collar can help reduce pressure on the trachea and prevent irritation.[2]

Further preventative treatment includes exercising your dog regularly and maintaining a healthy weight.[3] By taking these proactive steps, you can help lower the chances of your dog developing tracheitis.

## Differential Diagnosis

Tracheal and airway diseases can present with similar clinical signs as tracheitis, such as chronic coughing. Some key differential diagnoses to consider include:

[1] Tracheobronchitis (Kennel Cough): A common infectious respiratory disease in dogs that can cause a persistent, harsh cough. It is often suspected when a dog has a history of exposure to other affected dogs. [1]

[2] Tracheal Collapse: A progressive disease where weakening of the tracheal cartilage leads to airway narrowing and chronic coughing, especially in small breed dogs. [5] 

[3] Bronchomalacia: Airway collapse in the lower respiratory tract that can also result in chronic coughing, seen in both small and large breed dogs. [5]

[4] Laryngeal Diseases: Conditions affecting the larynx, such as laryngitis or paralysis, can present with stridor and dyspnea rather than primarily coughing. [4]

[5] Tracheal Tumors: Infrequent but can cause coughing, sometimes with dyspnea depending on tumor location and size. [4]

[6] Foreign Bodies: Plant material, stones, or other objects lodged in the trachea can trigger sudden, severe coughing and gagging. [4]

Careful history, physical exam, and diagnostic tests like imaging and endoscopy are needed to differentiate the underlying cause and guide appropriate treatment. [1,4,5]
