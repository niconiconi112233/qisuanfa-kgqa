## Disease Overview

Nasopharyngeal stenosis (NPS) is a pathological condition in cats characterized by a narrowing or obstruction within the nasopharynx, the area caudal to the choanae.[1,2] This condition is relatively uncommon, but appears to be more frequently diagnosed in cats than dogs.[3,4] 

The most common causes of NPS in cats are chronic rhinitis or a congenital deformity, while in dogs it is often associated with aspiration rhinitis.[1,2,3] NPS can occur as a congenital anomaly or secondary to an inflammatory condition, surgery, or a space-occupying lesion.[1,2,3]

NPS is typically diagnosed through a combination of diagnostic imaging, such as CT scans with 1mm slices to fully characterize the stenosis, and endoscopic examination, especially a retroflex rhinoscopy to visualize the narrowed nasopharyngeal opening.[1,2,4] Treatment options include surgical resection, serial balloon dilation, or placement of a nasopharyngeal stent, with stenting being a preferred option to prevent restenosis.[1,2,4]

## Common Pathogens

Nasopharyngeal stenosis, a narrowing of the nasal passage, can occur due to a variety of causes. Chronic inflammation and fibrosis (excess fibrous tissue formation) after an infection is one of the probable causes [1]. Inflammation following chronic regurgitation or vomiting of acidic material may also contribute to the development of this condition [1,4]. 

In some cases, the narrowing is caused by the formation of a thin but tough membrane in the nasal cavity [1,5]. This membrane can develop in any of the four portions of the nasal cavity, including the common, inferior, middle, or superior portions [1,5].

While nasopharyngeal stenosis is not a common condition in pets, it has been reported in both cats and dogs [1,5]. Careful diagnosis through medical history, physical examination, and imaging techniques like X-rays and CT scans is important to identify the underlying cause and guide appropriate treatment [1,4,5].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Patients with nasopharyngeal stenosis often exhibit a variety of respiratory symptoms. Common signs include whistling or snoring noises during breathing, difficulty breathing, and breathing through the open mouth.[1] Some dogs may also experience nasal discharge and worsening of symptoms during eating.[1] These respiratory issues often fail to respond to conventional therapies like antibiotics.[1] 

In cats, nasopharyngeal stenosis can lead to similar symptoms such as unusual nasal sounds, difficulty breathing, sneezing, and excessive nasal discharge.[3,4] Cats may also show decreased appetite due to the breathing difficulties.[4] A veterinary exam and diagnostic imaging are typically required to confirm the narrowing of the nasal passage in both dogs and cats.[1,3]

## Diagnostic Methods

Nasopharyngeal stenosis (NPS) is typically diagnosed through a combination of diagnostic techniques. Endoscopy is the primary method used to visualize the affected area and assess the severity of the stenosis [1]. Computed tomography (CT) imaging can also be helpful in evaluating the extent and location of the narrowing within the nasopharynx [1,2,4]. In some cases, skull radiographs may suggest the presence of NPS, though they are less definitive than endoscopy and CT [1,7,8].

Once NPS is suspected based on clinical signs, a thorough physical examination and history are important to rule out other potential causes. Standard laboratory tests such as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis are typically within normal limits for NPS patients [2]. However, these tests can help identify any concurrent conditions that may be contributing to the respiratory signs.

In summary, the key diagnostic tools for NPS include:

- Endoscopy - Direct visualization of the nasopharyngeal region to assess the stenosis [1]
- CT imaging - Detailed evaluation of the extent and location of the narrowing [1,2,4] 
- Skull radiographs - May suggest the presence of NPS, though less definitive [1,7,8]
- Physical exam and laboratory tests - To rule out other potential causes

## Treatment Options

Nasopharyngeal stenosis is a condition where the back of the nasal passage is narrowed or obstructed, leading to breathing difficulties. The primary treatment options are:

[1] Balloon dilation - A balloon is used to dilate the narrowed area, expanding the airway. This can provide temporary relief, but stenosis often recurs.

[2] Stent placement - A metallic or covered stent is inserted to hold the airway open. This can be more effective at preventing recurrence of stenosis, but carries risks like infection and fistula formation.

[3] Surgical resection - The affected tissue is surgically removed, but this is associated with high recurrence rates due to the underlying inflammatory conditions that often cause the stenosis.

The most common approach is to first try balloon dilation. If that is unsuccessful, placement of a metallic or covered stent is often the next step. Surgical resection is generally considered a last resort option given the high failure rates. Ongoing medication may also be required to manage any underlying inflammatory conditions. Overall, a combination of minimally invasive procedures and medical management appears to provide the best outcomes for patients with nasopharyngeal stenosis.

## Preventive Measures

To prevent nasopharyngeal stenosis, several strategies can be employed:

Vaccination: Ensuring the pet is up-to-date on core vaccinations, such as those for distemper and parainfluenza, can help reduce the risk of upper respiratory infections that can lead to stenosis [1]. 

Isolation: When a pet shows signs of an upper respiratory infection, isolating them from other animals can prevent the spread of pathogens that may exacerbate the condition [1].

Environmental Management: Avoiding irritants in the pet's environment, such as strong scents, smoke, and dusty conditions, can help minimize inflammation and prevent further narrowing of the nasal passages [2].

By taking these preventive measures, pet owners can help reduce the likelihood of their animal developing nasopharyngeal stenosis and the need for invasive treatment.

## Differential Diagnosis

Nasopharyngeal stenosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any feline patient presenting with chronic upper respiratory signs such as inspiratory stertor, dyspnea, nasal discharge, sneezing, and reverse sneezing [1,2]. Other conditions that can present with similar symptoms include:

Infectious agents causing granulomatous disease:
- Fungal infections like cryptococcosis and aspergillosis [2]
- Atypical bacterial infections like mycobacteriosis [2]

Inflammatory conditions:
- Nasopharyngeal polyps [2]
- Chronic rhinosinusitis, often secondary to viral infections like feline herpesvirus [2,5]
- Aspiration rhinitis from gastroesophageal reflux [6]

Neoplasia:
- Lymphoma
- Carcinoma [2]

Congenital abnormalities: 
- Choanal atresia [2,5]

Accumulation of nasal secretions:
- Infectious/inflammatory rhinosinusitis [2]
- Sinonasal cavity disease [2]

Foreign bodies [2]
