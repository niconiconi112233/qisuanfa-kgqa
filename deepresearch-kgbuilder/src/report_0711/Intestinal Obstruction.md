## Disease Overview

Intestinal obstruction is a common emergency condition in companion animals that can have serious consequences if not promptly treated. Obstruction can occur due to a variety of causes, most commonly the ingestion of indigestible foreign objects by dogs and cats. Other potential causes include intussusception, hernias, tumors, and narrowing of the intestinal tract. 

The obstruction can be partial or complete, and leads to vomiting, abdominal pain, and potentially life-threatening complications like fluid/electrolyte imbalances, intestinal tissue damage, and sepsis. Diagnosis typically involves imaging studies like radiographs and ultrasonography, which can help identify the location and severity of the obstruction. 

Treatment often requires surgical intervention to remove the offending object or correct the underlying cause. Supportive care with fluid therapy, antibiotics, and pain management is also crucial. The prognosis depends on the duration and severity of the obstruction, but prompt diagnosis and treatment generally result in a good outcome for most patients.

## Common Pathogens

Intestinal obstructions in pets can have a variety of causes, including both intraluminal and extraluminal factors. Common intraluminal causes include foreign bodies, tumors, and enteroliths.[1] Extraluminal causes may involve gut twists, adhesions, and hernias.[1] 

Intussusception, where one part of the intestine telescopes into another, is a frequent extraluminal cause of obstruction. This can be secondary to conditions like endoparasitic infection, parvoviral infection, foreign body ingestion, or neoplasia.[2] Congenital defects like pyloric stenosis can also lead to outflow obstruction.[2]

Foreign body ingestion is a common intraluminal cause, especially in dogs and cats. They may swallow toys, rocks, bones, or linear objects like string, yarn, or dental floss that can become lodged in the GI tract.[2,3] In older animals, masses or tumors are additional potential obstructive factors.[2]

Regardless of the underlying cause, unresolved intestinal obstructions lead to distention of the proximal GI tract with fluid and gas. This can ultimately result in devitalization of the bowel tissue, bacterial translocation, and sepsis if not addressed promptly.[2]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Intestinal obstruction in dogs and cats can present with a variety of clinical signs, including:

[1] Vomiting - Persistent vomiting is a common symptom as the obstruction prevents the normal passage of food and waste through the gastrointestinal tract. This can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. [2]

[2] Loss of appetite (anorexia) - Young pets with a foreign body obstruction may initially still try to eat but then vomit afterwards. Older pets may show no interest in eating at all. [3] 

[3] Abdominal pain - The obstruction can put pressure on the intestines, causing pain and even intestinal rupture or inflammation (peritonitis). [1,3]

[4] Weakness/lethargy - This is often due to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and pain. [1,3]

[5] Diarrhea, difficulty defecating, or straining to defecate - Partial obstructions may allow some liquid to pass, causing diarrhea, while complete obstructions prevent any stool from being passed. [1,3]

[6] Weight loss - As the obstruction prevents nutrient absorption, pets may lose weight over time. [3]

Prompt veterinary attention is crucial, as intestinal obstructions are surgical emergencies that can quickly become life-threatening if left untreated. [1,3]

## Diagnostic Methods

Veterinarians use a combination of clinical signs, imaging, and laboratory testing to diagnose intestinal obstruction in pets:

Physical examination and history: The veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam, palpating the abdomen for signs of pain or abnormal masses. They will also ask about the pet's symptoms, diet, and any potential ingestion of foreign objects.

Imaging:
- Radiographs (X-rays): These can reveal gas or fluid distention of the intestines, as well as potentially visualize radiopaque foreign bodies. However, some objects like string or cloth may not be visible on X-rays.
- Abdominal ultrasound: This can help detect foreign bodies, intussusception, or other abnormalities causing obstruction. Ultrasound is more sensitive than X-rays for detecting some types of obstructions.
- Advanced imaging (CT, fluoroscopy): If initial tests are inconclusive, more detailed imaging like CT scans or fluoroscopy may be recommended to better characterize the obstruction.

Laboratory testing:
- Complete blood count (CBC) and chemistry panel: These can identify dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or other systemic effects of the obstruction.
- Fecal exam: This can rule out intestinal parasites as a potential cause.

Diagnosis is often a combination of the pet's clinical signs, results of diagnostic imaging, and laboratory findings. In some cases, surgical exploration may be needed to definitively identify and remove the cause of the obstruction. [1,2,3]

## Treatment Options

Intestinal obstruction in pets is a serious medical condition that requires prompt veterinary attention. The treatment approach depends on the underlying cause and severity of the obstruction.

For mild or partial obstructions, medical management may be possible. This can involve inducing vomiting to remove the object, administering fluids and medications to help the object pass, and closely monitoring the pet's progress with regular imaging [1]. However, if the obstruction is complete or the pet's condition deteriorates, surgery is typically required.

Surgical treatment involves opening the abdomen (laparotomy) to locate and remove the obstructing object [1,2]. This may involve making an incision into the stomach or intestines (enterotomy) to extract a foreign body, or resecting and reconnecting damaged sections of the intestines if necrosis has occurred [2,3]. 

After surgery, supportive care is critical. Pets require IV fluids, pain medication, and close monitoring as they recover [1,2]. A temporary feeding tube may be needed if the pet is not eating on its own [2]. Antibiotics are often prescribed to prevent infection [3].

With prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment, many pets make a full recovery from intestinal obstructions [1]. However, prognosis worsens if there is significant intestinal damage or if the underlying cause is a tumor or other serious condition [1,2]. Preventing future obstructions involves limiting access to potential foreign objects.

## Preventive Measures

Preventing intestinal obstruction in companion animals starts with environmental management and vaccination. Owners should carefully monitor their pets and avoid allowing them access to objects or materials they could accidentally ingest, such as toys, socks, and bones. The "leave it" command can be taught to discourage dogs from investigating and consuming foreign objects [1]. Additionally, regular deworming and vaccination against parasites like roundworms can help prevent intestinal blockages caused by intestinal parasites [2].

## Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for intestinal obstruction in dogs and cats includes a variety of conditions that can lead to similar clinical signs. Some key points to consider when differentiating the diagnosis:

[1] Intestinal foreign bodies are the most common cause of mechanical obstruction, accounting for around 80% of cases. These can be single or multiple objects that get lodged in the gastrointestinal tract. Radiographic signs include segmental dilation of the intestines and visualization of the radiopaque foreign material.[2]

Intestinal neoplasia, particularly in older animals, can also cause obstructive symptoms. These tumors may be difficult to visualize on radiographs, but can lead to dilation and distortion of the intestinal loops.[3] 

[4] Intussusception, where one segment of intestine telescopes into an adjacent segment, is another potential cause. This may present with a "target" or "bull's-eye" appearance on abdominal imaging. Intestinal intussusception is more common in younger dogs and cats.

Other less common causes include intestinal strictures, adhesions from previous surgery, hernias, and severe intestinal inflammation or parasitism. These may not always produce the classic radiographic signs of marked intestinal dilation.[3]

In some cases, the initial radiographs may be inconclusive. Repeat imaging 12-18 hours later can sometimes help differentiate a true mechanical obstruction from other gastrointestinal disorders.[5] If radiographs remain equivocal, additional imaging such as abdominal ultrasound or CT may be warranted to make the diagnosis.
