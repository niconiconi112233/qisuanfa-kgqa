## Disease Overview

Acute colitis is a common condition in both dogs and cats, characterized by inflammation of the colon that can result in large bowel diarrhea. The inflammation may have infectious, traumatic, uremic, or allergic causes, though the underlying inciting factor is often unknown. 

Acute colitis develops with mucosal infiltration of neutrophils and epithelial disruption and ulceration. Chronic colitis is often characterized by mucosal infiltration of plasma cells and lymphocytes, fibrosis, and sometimes ulceration.

Granulomatous colitis is a rare, breed-specific condition in young Boxers and French Bulldogs, histologically characterized by granulomatous infiltration and bacterial invasion of the colonic wall. Pseudomembranous colitis, a very rare condition in dogs and cats, is associated with Clostridioides difficile infection.

Epidemiologically, colitis is common in both dogs and cats. Most affected dogs are middle-aged with no sex predilection, while cats with chronic colitis tend to be middle-aged and more commonly purebred. Granulomatous colitis typically affects animals under 4 years old, with Boxers and French Bulldogs predominantly affected.

## Common Pathogens

The main causative agents associated with acute colitis include:

Bacterial infections such as Salmonella and Clostridium [1]. Dogs who are exposed to more bacteria, such as those on a raw food diet, are at higher risk for these bacterial colitis infections [1].

Parasitic infections like whipworm, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium can also lead to colitis, especially in puppies [1]. Symptoms can include bloody stool, straining, abdominal bloating, dull coat, and excess hunger [1].

Stress and anxiety can also negatively impact the gut and lead to colitis by impairing the immune system and disrupting the gut microbiome [1].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Dogs and cats with acute colitis typically exhibit a sudden onset of gastrointestinal symptoms. These include frequent, small volumes of semi-formed to liquid stool [1], as well as straining, cramping, and a sense of urgency to defecate [4]. Vomiting can also be a feature, along with lethargy, anorexia, and dehydration in more severe cases [2]. The stool may contain mucus or fresh blood [1,5]. Severe cases of pseudomembranous colitis can present with large bowel diarrhea, weakness, and even tenesmus (constant, painful urge to pass stool) [2].

## Diagnostic Methods

To identify the cause of acute colitis, veterinarians typically follow a step-wise approach:

[1] Obtain a thorough patient history and conduct a physical examination, including rectal palpation. This can provide clues about the underlying cause, such as recent dietary changes, travel, stress, or presence of parasites.

[2] Perform fecal testing to rule out infectious causes like parasites (e.g. giardia, whipworms) or bacterial infections (e.g. Clostridium, Salmonella, Campylobacter).

[3] If the initial workup is unremarkable, recommend a dietary trial with an easily digestible, high-fiber, or hypoallergenic diet. This can help identify any food intolerances.

[4] If the diarrhea persists, additional testing may be needed, such as:
- Complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis to assess the overall health status
- Abdominal radiographs or ultrasound to evaluate the intestinal tract
- Endoscopy with biopsies to visually inspect the colon and obtain samples for histopathology

[5] In some cases, particularly with young Boxers and French Bulldogs, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) testing on biopsy samples may be indicated to diagnose granulomatous colitis, a rare breed-specific condition.

The specific diagnostic approach is tailored to each patient based on the history, physical exam findings, and response to initial management. A combination of clinical assessment, fecal testing, imaging, and endoscopic evaluation is often required to identify the underlying cause of acute or chronic colitis in dogs.

## Treatment Options

Dietary management is often the first step in treating colitis in dogs. Supplementing the diet with fiber can help reduce water content in the stool, prolong transit time, and improve intestinal contractions. Fiber can be added through a prescription high-fiber diet, canned pumpkin, or psyllium. 

If dietary changes are not effective, your veterinarian may prescribe medications such as metronidazole, tylosin, or sulfasalazine. These antibiotics can have anti-inflammatory properties that help resolve colitis. In more severe or chronic cases, glucocorticoids like prednisone or prednisolone may be used to reduce inflammation. Immunosuppressive drugs like azathioprine or chlorambucil may also be prescribed if the response to steroids is not satisfactory.

Modulating the gut microbiome can also be beneficial. Probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation have been used to help restore a healthy bacterial balance in the colon. However, further research is still needed on the efficacy of these approaches.

## Preventive Measures

To prevent acute colitis, pet owners can take several preventive measures:

[1] Proper dietary management is crucial. Supplementing the diet with fiber, either through a commercial high-fiber diet or by adding fiber supplements like psyllium, can help maintain healthy colonic function and prevent diarrhea. Novel protein or hydrolyzed protein diets may also be helpful in pets with suspected food allergies. [1]

[2] Strict control of parasites is important, as certain parasites like whipworms can contribute to the development of colitis. Regular deworming, even if fecal exams are negative, is recommended. [1]

[3] Limiting exposure to environmental stressors, such as changes in routine, boarding, travel, or new household members, can help reduce the risk of stress-induced colitis flare-ups. [1] 

[4] Fecal microbiota transplantation has shown promise in managing chronic colitis in dogs and cats, likely by helping to restore a healthy gut microbiome. This may be a useful preventive measure for pets prone to recurrent colitis. [1]

[5] In some cases, anti-inflammatory medications or immunosuppressants may be used long-term to prevent relapses of chronic colonic inflammation, though their use should be carefully monitored by a veterinarian. [1]

## Differential Diagnosis

Colitis can have a variety of underlying causes that may present with similar symptoms. Some key differential diagnoses to consider include:

[1] Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): IBD is a common cause of chronic colitis in dogs and cats, characterized by inflammation of the intestinal lining. Breeds predisposed to IBD include German shepherds, boxers, and French bulldogs. [1]

[2] Stress-induced colitis: Stress is one of the leading causes of acute large bowel diarrhea in dogs. Environmental or emotional stressors can trigger increased intestinal motility and inflammation. [1] 

[3] Parasitic infections: Intestinal parasites such as whipworms (_Trichuris vulpis_) and giardia can cause colitis-like symptoms in dogs. Fecal testing is recommended to rule out parasitic causes. [1]

[4] Clostridium difficile infection: This bacterium can cause pseudomembranous colitis, characterized by severe, watery diarrhea. However, this condition is rare in dogs and cats. [1]

[5] Neoplasia: Rectal or colonic tumors may mimic clinical signs of colitis, including large bowel diarrhea and tenesmus. A thorough rectal exam is needed to identify any masses. [1]

To differentiate these conditions, a combination of dietary trials, fecal testing, imaging, and endoscopic evaluation with biopsies may be required. Treatment would then be tailored to the underlying cause.
