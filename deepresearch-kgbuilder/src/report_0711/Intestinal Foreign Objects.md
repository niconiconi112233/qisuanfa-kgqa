## Disease Overview

Intestinal foreign objects are some of the most common causes of intestinal obstruction in dogs and cats. The size of the foreign body determines whether the obstruction is partial or complete. Foreign bodies can be any non-food item that a pet swallows, such as toys, socks, string, bones, or even mulch. These objects can become lodged in the esophagus, stomach, or intestinal tract, causing blockages that require veterinary care.

The clinical signs of an intestinal foreign body vary based on the location and duration of the obstruction. The most common signs are vomiting, loss of appetite, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and lethargy. Pets with linear foreign bodies (e.g. string, fabric) often have more severe symptoms like persistent vomiting, rapid dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.

Diagnosis typically involves radiographs, which can show evidence of an obstruction even if the foreign body itself is not visible. Abdominal ultrasound may also be used, as it can be more accurate than x-rays in detecting gastrointestinal foreign bodies. Immediate surgical intervention is required for complete obstructions or perforations, while partial obstructions may be managed medically for up to 12 hours before surgery.

The prognosis is generally excellent when there is no evidence of perforation. However, foreign bodies that cause intestinal ischemia, necrosis, or peritonitis can have a poorer outcome. Factors associated with increased mortality include the presence of a linear foreign body, longer duration of clinical signs, and the need for multiple surgical procedures.

## Common Pathogens

Gastrointestinal (GI) foreign bodies in dogs and cats can lead to a variety of complications, but they are not typically caused by specific viral or bacterial pathogens. The primary issues arise from the mechanical obstruction and potential perforation of the GI tract by the foreign object [1].

When a foreign body becomes lodged in the stomach or intestines, it can cause partial or complete blockage of the GI tract. This prevents the normal passage of food and waste, leading to accumulation of fluid, gas, and ingesta. The obstruction can also cause inflammation, edema, and necrosis of the surrounding tissues [2]. 

If the foreign body perforates the GI wall, it allows leakage of intestinal contents into the abdominal cavity. This can rapidly lead to life-threatening peritonitis and sepsis [3]. The type of material making up the foreign body (e.g. sharp, toxic) can also directly damage or poison the GI tissues.

While bacterial overgrowth and secondary infections may occur, the primary pathology stems from the mechanical issues caused by the obstruction and perforation, rather than specific infectious agents. Prompt surgical intervention is usually required to remove the foreign body and manage the associated tissue damage [2,3].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Dogs with intestinal foreign bodies often display a range of clinical symptoms and signs. Common symptoms include persistent vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, weakness/lethargy, and difficulty defecating or straining to defecate [1,2,3]. In some cases, diarrhea may also be present as liquid passes around the obstruction [3].

Vomiting is a particularly concerning symptom, as it can lead to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalances [1,2]. Young dogs with a foreign body obstruction may initially still eat but then vomit afterwards [2]. Additionally, dogs with a complete intestinal blockage may not produce any stool, which is a strong indication of an obstruction [2].

Other physical examination findings associated with intestinal foreign bodies include a palpable abdominal mass, signs of peritoneal irritation, and evidence of dehydration [3,4]. Radiographs and ultrasound can help confirm the presence and location of the obstruction [4].

In summary, the key clinical symptoms and signs of intestinal foreign bodies in dogs include vomiting, inappetence, abdominal pain, lethargy, and defecation difficulties. Prompt veterinary attention is critical for these cases, as unresolved obstructions can lead to life-threatening complications.

## Diagnostic Methods

Dogs and cats can ingest a variety of foreign objects that can become lodged in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, leading to an obstructive emergency. The clinical presentation, laboratory testing, and imaging are key to diagnosing these cases.

Clinical signs of a GI foreign body obstruction can vary based on the severity and location of the blockage. Common signs include vomiting, anorexia, lethargy, abdominal pain, and diarrhea [1]. More proximal obstructions often cause persistent vomiting and rapid dehydration, while distal obstructions tend to have less severe vomiting but more intestinal fluid/gas sequestration [2].

Laboratory testing may reveal leukocytosis, electrolyte imbalances, and metabolic disturbances depending on the extent of the obstruction. Hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis are typical with proximal obstructions, while metabolic acidosis is more common with distal obstructions [2,3].

Radiographs are often the first-line imaging modality used to diagnose GI foreign bodies. Radiopaque objects can be directly visualized, while signs of intestinal obstruction like fluid/gas distension may be seen even with radiolucent objects [2,3]. Contrast radiographs can be helpful for detecting radiolucent foreign bodies. Abdominal ultrasound may also be used, as it can identify the presence of foreign bodies and intestinal distension [2,3].

In some cases, endoscopic examination may be required to identify and potentially retrieve proximal foreign bodies. However, for distal obstructions or cases with suspected perforation, surgical exploration is often necessary to fully evaluate the GI tract and remove the offending object [2,3].

## Treatment Options

Gastrointestinal foreign bodies in pets often require surgical intervention for removal. The specific treatment approach depends on the location and type of foreign object.

[1] Some smaller, smooth foreign bodies may be able to pass through the gastrointestinal tract without issue. In these cases, the pet may be monitored with periodic x-rays to track the object's progress, and surgery can be avoided if the object continues to move through. However, if the object becomes stuck or the pet shows signs of obstruction, surgical removal is typically required.

[2] For foreign bodies located in the stomach, endoscopic removal may be possible. This involves using a flexible camera to locate and retrieve the object through the mouth without requiring surgery. However, endoscopy is limited to the stomach and cannot access objects that have moved further into the intestines.

[3] Most gastrointestinal foreign bodies become lodged in the stomach or intestines and require either a gastrotomy (opening the stomach) or enterotomy (opening the intestine) to remove the object. The surgeon will carefully examine the entire gastrointestinal tract to ensure all foreign material has been found and removed. Damaged or perforated sections of the intestines may need to be surgically resected and reconnected.

[4] In addition to the surgical procedure, supportive care is critical. Pets require intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and pain medication before, during, and after surgery to address dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and discomfort. A bland, easily digestible diet is often provided after surgery to allow the gastrointestinal tract to heal.

[5] Close monitoring for complications like leakage at the surgical site is required in the days following the procedure. Pets are usually hospitalized for 1-3 days after foreign body removal surgery, with activity restricted for 2 weeks to allow the incision to fully heal.

With prompt diagnosis and appropriate surgical and supportive care, the prognosis for pets with gastrointestinal foreign bodies is generally good, especially if the obstruction has not caused severe damage or perforation of the intestines. Prevention focuses on keeping potentially ingested objects out of reach and closely supervising pets to avoid foreign body ingestion.

## Preventive Measures

To prevent intestinal foreign objects in pets, veterinarians recommend the following strategies:

[1] Keep small, chewable objects out of your dog's reach. Avoid giving your dog items that can be easily swallowed, such as small bones or small toys. Supervise your dog during playtime to prevent ingestion of inappropriate items. [2]

Train your dog to avoid scavenging or eating things they shouldn't. Consider [3] basket muzzle training as a preventive measure against object ingestion if your dog resists other methods or has had to undergo surgery for foreign body removal more than once. [4]

Proper environmental management and supervision can go a long way in preventing foreign body ingestion in curious pets. Taking these precautions can help avoid the serious complications and need for emergency surgery that intestinal foreign objects can cause.

## Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating a patient with suspected intestinal foreign objects, several other potential causes of gastrointestinal obstruction should be considered in the differential diagnosis:

[1] Intestinal neoplasia - Tumors or abnormal growths within the intestinal wall can physically obstruct the intestinal lumen and prevent the normal flow of digesta. This is more common in older animals. [2]

[2] Intussusception - This occurs when one segment of the intestine telescopes or invaginates into an adjacent segment, creating a physical obstruction. It is a common cause of obstruction, especially in younger animals. [2,4]

[3] Intestinal strictures or adhesions - Scarring or bands of fibrous tissue can narrow the intestinal lumen and impede passage of digesta. This may be due to previous surgery or inflammation. [4]

[4] Severe intestinal parasitism - Heavy infestations with intestinal worms can cause partial or complete obstruction by mass effect or creating an impaction. [4]

[5] Hernias - Intestinal loops can become trapped within abdominal wall or diaphragmatic defects, leading to strangulation and obstruction. [4]

[6] Intestinal torsion - Twisting of the intestines can abruptly obstruct the intestinal lumen. [4]

Careful consideration of the patient's history, physical exam findings, and imaging results will help differentiate these potential causes and guide appropriate treatment. Surgical exploration may be required in some cases to definitively identify the underlying cause of the obstruction.
