## Disease Overview

Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) is an acute, life-threatening disorder in dogs characterized by abnormal twisting of the stomach on its mesenteric axis, with subsequent gastric gas accumulation and distention. [1] Large and deep-chested dog breeds are considered to be the most at risk for GDV, including the German shepherd, Great Dane, standard poodle, Saint Bernard, Doberman pinscher, Irish setter, and Weimaraner. [2,4] The incidence of GDV increases with increasing age, and middle-aged to older dogs are most commonly affected. [2]

Overall, a study of 77,088 dogs attending 50 UK emergency-care veterinary practices found a prevalence of 0.64% for presumptive GDV diagnoses. [1] Compared to crossbred dogs, breeds with the highest odds ratios for GDV were the Great Dane, Akita, and Dogue de Bordeaux. [1] Additionally, neutered male dogs had 1.3 times the odds of developing GDV compared to entire females. [1]

## Common Pathogens

Gastric dilatation and volvulus (GDV) is a life-threatening condition in dogs, but it is extremely rare in cats. [1] While no definitive cause has been identified, several potential risk factors have been reported in dogs, including large meals, heavy exercise after meals, and genetic predisposition. [1] 

Some studies have suggested that GI dysmotility and the presence of gastric foreign bodies may contribute to the development of GDV in cats. [2] However, the underlying causes are still not well understood. 

Overall, GDV appears to be a complex condition without a single identifiable pathogen or cause. Rather, it seems to involve a combination of anatomical, physiological, and environmental factors that can predispose certain dogs, and very rarely cats, to this dangerous condition.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Gastric dilation and volvulus (GDV) is an acute, life-threatening condition that primarily affects large- and giant-breed dogs. Dogs with GDV may present with a history of nonproductive retching, hypersalivation, and restlessness [1]. Acute or progressive abdominal distention may be noted, or the affected dog may be found recumbent and depressed with an enlarged abdomen [1].

Physical examination findings include an enlarged or tympanic abdomen [1]. Abdominal pain and/or splenomegaly may be appreciated on abdominal palpation [1]. Progression from gastric dilation to volvulus predisposes to hypovolemic shock, and signs of shock are common, including weak peripheral pulses, tachycardia, prolonged capillary refill time, pale mucous membranes, and dyspnea [1]. An irregular heart rate and pulse deficits may indicate the presence of a cardiac arrhythmia [1]. Additionally, the expanding stomach may compress the thoracic cavity and inhibit diaphragmatic movement, leading to respiratory distress [1].

## Diagnostic Methods

Veterinarians use a combination of diagnostic tests and imaging techniques to confirm a diagnosis of gastric dilatation and volvulus (GDV) and differentiate it from other conditions.

Abdominal radiography, particularly the right lateral projection, is the primary diagnostic tool for GDV [1]. A healthy dog typically has no gas in the pylorus, but in a dog with GDV, the stomach is dilated with gas and shows the characteristic "double bubble" sign, indicating craniodorsal displacement of the pylorus [1]. An orthogonal (dorsoventral) view may also be acquired, depending on the patient's stability [1].

Blood work, including a complete blood count, serum chemistry, and coagulation profile, can provide additional information. Elevated lactate levels are associated with a higher likelihood of gastric necrosis and a poorer prognosis [2,3]. Electrocardiography (ECG) is used to monitor for cardiac arrhythmias, which are common in GDV patients [1].

Thoracic radiographs may be obtained to check for comorbidities, such as metastatic disease or cardiomegaly, which can negatively impact the prognosis [1].

In summary, the diagnostic approach for GDV involves a combination of abdominal radiography, blood work, and ECG monitoring to confirm the diagnosis, assess the severity of the condition, and guide treatment.

## Treatment Options

Immediate medical stabilization and surgical intervention are crucial for managing gastric dilation in dogs. The key treatment steps include:

[1] Fluid resuscitation: Aggressive intravenous fluid therapy with crystalloids, colloids, and/or hypertonic saline is required to correct hypovolemia and shock. [1][2]

[2] Gastric decompression: Passage of an orogastric tube or percutaneous gastrocentesis is performed to relieve gastric distension and allow gas/fluid release. [1][2] 

[3] Surgical correction: After initial stabilization, emergency surgery is performed to reposition the stomach, evaluate for gastric/splenic necrosis, and perform gastropexy to prevent recurrence. Partial gastrectomy or splenectomy may be required in some cases. [1][2][4]

[4] Supportive care: Postoperative management includes continued fluid therapy, pain control, anti-arrhythmic drugs (if needed), and monitoring for complications like sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation. [1][2]

Prognosis is guarded, with mortality rates reported around 10-28% in treated dogs. Negative prognostic factors include gastric necrosis, the need for splenectomy or partial gastrectomy, and persistent hyperlactatemia. [1][2][4] Prophylactic gastropexy is often recommended in high-risk breeds to prevent recurrence. [5]

## Preventive Measures

To help prevent gastric dilation, a life-threatening condition in dogs, veterinary experts recommend the following:

1. Feed smaller, more frequent meals rather than one large meal. Consuming large portions of food at once can increase the risk of bloat [1,2]. 

2. Avoid elevated feeding bowls, as they may actually increase the risk of gastric dilation in large and giant breed dogs [2].

3. Use feeding strategies that slow the rate of eating, such as puzzle feeders or spreading food across multiple shallow bowls. This can reduce the amount of air swallowed while eating [1,2].

4. Avoid feeding immediately before or after exercise, as physical activity can contribute to the development of bloat [1,5].

5. Provide only small, frequent sips of water rather than allowing dogs to drink large amounts at once. Using a slow-feed water bowl can help control water intake [5].

6. Consider prophylactic gastropexy surgery, which surgically attaches the stomach to the body wall to prevent twisting, in high-risk breeds. This has a 95% success rate in preventing recurrence of gastric dilation-volvulus [3].

By implementing these preventive measures, pet owners can significantly reduce the risk of this life-threatening condition in their dogs.

## Differential Diagnosis

Gastric dilation and volvulus (GDV) is an acute, life-threatening condition that primarily affects large- and giant-breed dogs. However, other gastrointestinal conditions can present with similar symptoms and should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

Emphysematous gastritis is a condition characterized by the presence of gas within the gastric wall, which can occur without the dilation and volvulus associated with GDV [1,2]. Compared to GDV, emphysematous gastritis may present with more severe systemic signs like lethargy, hematemesis, anemia, or leukocytosis. Radiographic findings like the presence of gas within the gastric wall, rather than just gastric dilation, can help differentiate emphysematous gastritis from GDV.

Idiopathic megaesophagus is another condition that can cause regurgitation and vomiting in dogs. Unlike GDV, megaesophagus is characterized by esophageal dilation and hypomotility rather than gastric dilation and volvulus [3]. Radiographic evaluation of the esophagus can help distinguish megaesophagus from GDV.

Additionally, gastrointestinal obstructions, whether mechanical or functional, can lead to vomiting that may be mistaken for GDV. Distinction between these conditions is based on the specific radiographic and ultrasonographic findings associated with each type of obstruction.

In summary, while GDV is the primary concern in large- and giant-breed dogs presenting with acute vomiting and abdominal distension, other conditions like emphysematous gastritis and megaesophagus should be considered in the differential diagnosis based on the specific clinical and diagnostic imaging features. Prompt recognition and differentiation is critical for appropriate treatment and management.

# Gastric Dilation: A Life-Threatening Condition in Dogs

Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) is an acute, dangerous disorder in dogs characterized by the abnormal twisting of the stomach, leading to gas accumulation and distension. Large and deep-chested breeds are most at risk, with the incidence increasing with age. While no single cause has been identified, potential factors include heavy exercise after meals and genetic predisposition. Prompt recognition and treatment are critical, as GDV can rapidly progress to hypovolemic shock and respiratory distress.

## Summary

GDV is a complex, multifactorial condition that requires immediate stabilization and surgical intervention to reposition the stomach and prevent recurrence. Aggressive fluid resuscitation, gastric decompression, and emergency surgery are the mainstays of treatment. Preventive measures like smaller, more frequent meals and avoidance of elevated feeding bowls can significantly reduce the risk in high-risk breeds. With prompt care, the prognosis for affected dogs is guarded, but mortality rates remain around 10-28%. Continued research into the underlying causes and refinement of treatment approaches are needed to improve outcomes for this life-threatening condition.
