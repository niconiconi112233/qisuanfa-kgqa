## Disease Overview

Anaplasmosis is a tick-borne disease caused by the bacterial organism *Anaplasma phagocytophilum*. [1] It is transmitted through the bites of deer ticks and Western black-legged ticks. [1,2] Anaplasmosis can affect a variety of animals, including dogs, cats, horses, and humans, but is more commonly reported in dogs. [1,3] 

The disease typically causes symptoms such as fever, lethargy, poor appetite, and joint pain in dogs around 1-2 weeks after tick exposure. [1,4,5] Some infected animals may never show signs of illness. [4,5] Diagnosis is made through blood tests that detect the organism or antibodies against it. [1,4,5] Treatment with the antibiotic doxycycline is usually effective, with most dogs recovering within a few days of starting medication. [1,4,5] Prevention focuses on tick control through the use of topical products and limiting exposure to tick-infested areas. [4,5]

## Common Pathogens

Anaplasmosis in companion animals is caused by two main pathogens:

[1] *Anaplasma phagocytophilum* - This pathogen primarily infects neutrophils and is transmitted by ticks, particularly *Ixodes scapularis* (the black-legged tick) in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States, and *Ixodes pacificus* on the West Coast. Infections with *A. phagocytophilum* can cause acute disease in dogs with symptoms like fever, lethargy, anorexia, and thrombocytopenia. [1,2]

[2] *Anaplasma platys* - This pathogen infects platelets and is transmitted by the brown dog tick (*Rhipicephalus sanguineus*), which is found throughout the southern United States. *A. platys* infections in dogs typically cause recurrent, cyclic thrombocytopenia, but clinical signs may be mild or even subclinical. [1,2] 

Both *Anaplasma* species are obligate intracellular bacteria that can cause illness in dogs, but *A. phagocytophilum* tends to be more pathogenic and cause more severe clinical presentations. Coinfections with multiple tick-borne pathogens, including *Borrelia burgdorferi* (the causative agent of Lyme disease), are also common and can complicate the clinical picture. [2]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Anaplasmosis in cats typically presents with nonspecific symptoms such as poor appetite, lethargy, fever, and joint pain [1]. Some cats may also exhibit symptoms associated with bleeding, including a bloody nose, dark bloody stool, and bruising [1]. In rare cases, cats may develop a wobbly gait or have seizures [1]. 

However, not all cats infected with the Anaplasma bacteria will show clinical signs [1]. Some cats may only appear sick for a short time before recovering, likely due to their immune system's ability to fight off the infection [1].

## Diagnostic Methods

Dogs with anaplasmosis may exhibit a variety of clinical signs, including fever, anorexia, lethargy, polyarthritis, epistaxis, or petechiae, depending on the specific agent responsible for the infection.[1] However, many dogs with circulating antibodies to Anaplasma species do not exhibit obvious signs of disease.[1]

Diagnosis of anaplasmosis typically involves a combination of methods. Serological tests, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), can detect antibodies to Anaplasma species, but these tests do not distinguish between active infection and past exposure.[1,2] Blood smear examination may reveal the presence of morulae (intracellular inclusions) within neutrophils (*A. phagocytophilum*) or platelets (*A. platys*).[1,2] Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of whole blood or tissue samples can also be used to detect the organism's DNA, but a negative PCR result does not rule out infection, particularly in chronic cases.[1,2] 

Given the limitations of each individual diagnostic method, a multimodal approach incorporating clinical signs, hematology, serology, and PCR is recommended for diagnosing anaplasmosis in dogs.[1,2] This allows veterinarians to better determine the significance of positive serological results and the need for treatment.

## Treatment Options

Dogs with anaplasmosis often respond quickly to treatment with the antibiotic doxycycline. After starting the medication, dogs typically feel better within 1-2 days, but the full course of treatment typically lasts 2-4 weeks.[1,2,3] In some cases, an extended 4-week course may be necessary if the dog is also infected with Lyme disease.[2] 

In addition to the antibiotic, supportive care such as fluid therapy or pain medication may be needed depending on the dog's symptoms and clinical condition.[2,3] Rarely, an immune-mediated component can occur, requiring treatment with steroids and other supportive care.[2]

For dogs that test positive for anaplasmosis but do not show any clinical signs, treatment is usually not necessary. These dogs should still receive close monitoring and have their tick prevention methods reevaluated, as they may be chronic carriers of the infection.[2,3] Trying to clear the infection with additional antibiotics in these asymptomatic cases is generally not recommended.

## Preventive Measures

The best way to prevent anaplasmosis in dogs is through stringent tick prevention. Effective spot-on treatments, oral medications, and tick collars are recommended to control ticks.[1] Daily tick checks and prompt tick removal are also important.[1] Avoiding high-risk areas like wooded regions with dense undergrowth can help reduce exposure to infected ticks.[2] 

There is no vaccine available to prevent anaplasmosis, so tick control is crucial. Owners should also manage their yard by keeping the grass short and removing leaf piles to make the environment less attractive to ticks.[2] Taking these preventive measures can significantly reduce the risk of anaplasmosis in dogs.

## Differential Diagnosis

Anaplasmosis shares similar symptoms with other tick-borne diseases, so it is important to consider a differential diagnosis. 

Dogs with anaplasmosis often have many of the same symptoms as those with Lyme disease, such as fever, lethargy, malaise, anorexia, and joint pain leading to lameness.[1] Co-infection with both anaplasmosis and Lyme disease is also common.[2] Since these two diseases are transmitted by the same tick vectors and have overlapping geographic distributions, they can be difficult to distinguish based on clinical signs alone.

Another tick-borne disease that can cause clinical signs similar to anaplasmosis is canine granulocytic ehrlichiosis, which is caused by Ehrlichia ewingii.[1] The morulae (infectious agents) of E. ewingii cannot be distinguished from those of Anaplasma phagocytophilum under a microscope, and the clinical manifestations of the two diseases are identical.[1]

In summary, the key differential diagnoses for anaplasmosis include:

- Lyme disease
- Canine granulocytic ehrlichiosis

Careful diagnostic testing, including serology and PCR, is often required to distinguish between these tick-borne diseases and determine the appropriate treatment.

# Pet Disease: Anaplasmosis

Anaplasmosis is a tick-borne disease that can affect a variety of animals, including dogs, cats, and humans. Caused by the bacterial pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum, this disease is transmitted through the bites of deer ticks and Western black-legged ticks. While some infected animals may never show signs of illness, common symptoms include fever, lethargy, poor appetite, and joint pain. Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical signs, blood tests, and specialized laboratory techniques. Prompt treatment with the antibiotic doxycycline is typically effective, but preventing tick exposure through the use of topical products and avoiding tick-infested areas is key to reducing the risk of anaplasmosis.

## Conclusion

Anaplasmosis is a complex tick-borne disease that requires a multifaceted approach for effective diagnosis and management. Veterinarians must consider a range of differential diagnoses, as the clinical signs can overlap with other tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease. Serological tests and PCR analysis are critical for confirming the presence of Anaplasma species and guiding appropriate antibiotic therapy. While most dogs respond well to doxycycline treatment, prevention through rigorous tick control remains the best defense against this potentially serious condition. By understanding the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic methods for anaplasmosis, veterinary professionals can provide the best possible care for affected pets.
