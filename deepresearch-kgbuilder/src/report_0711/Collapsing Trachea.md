## Disease Overview

Tracheal collapse (TC) is a common condition in small-breed dogs, characterized by a weakening and flattening of the tracheal cartilage rings. This leads to a decrease in tracheal diameter in the cervical or thoracic regions due to negative pressure during respiration. TC is particularly prevalent in certain small breeds like Yorkshire Terriers, Pomeranians, and Chihuahuas.

The disease has a multifactorial etiology, including congenital factors like cartilage malformation or weakness, as well as acquired factors like chronic respiratory disease or obesity. Diagnosis typically involves a combination of clinical signs, radiographic imaging, and fluoroscopic evaluation. Fluoroscopy is considered the most useful technique, as it can dynamically assess the location and severity of collapse during different phases of respiration.

TC is graded from I (mild) to IV (most severe) based on the percentage of tracheal lumen obstruction. While medical management with medications like cough suppressants and anti-inflammatories is often the first-line approach, surgical interventions like tracheal ring prostheses or intraluminal stents may be required for severe or refractory cases. Successful management of TC aims to limit disease progression and control clinical signs to improve the patient's quality of life.

## Common Pathogens

The main causes of collapsing trachea in dogs are not due to specific viral or bacterial pathogens. Instead, the condition is primarily caused by a weakening or flattening of the cartilage rings that support the trachea, leading to a narrowing of the airway. This weakening of the tracheal cartilage is thought to have multiple underlying factors, potentially including genetics, obesity, and other medical conditions.[1][2][3]

While dogs with collapsing trachea may be more prone to developing respiratory infections due to the inflammation and narrowing of the airway, there are no known specific viral or bacterial causes of the condition itself. Any respiratory infections that do occur are typically secondary to the tracheal collapse, rather than the primary driver of the disease.[1][4]

In summary, collapsing trachea in dogs is not caused by any particular viral or bacterial pathogens, but rather by the structural changes and weakening of the tracheal cartilage over time. Treatment focuses on managing the tracheal collapse through medication, lifestyle changes, and in some cases, surgical intervention.[1][2][3]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

One of the most common signs of a collapsing trachea in dogs is a persistent, harsh and dry cough, often described as a "goose-honking" cough [1]. This cough may worsen with exercise, excitement, stress, or when pressure is applied to the throat [2,3].

Other symptoms can include retching, rapid or difficult breathing, exercise intolerance, blue-tinged gums, and even fainting [2,3]. In severe cases, the airway can become so narrowed that the dog experiences respiratory distress and requires immediate veterinary attention [1].

Tracheal collapse is a progressive condition, and symptoms tend to worsen over time as the tracheal cartilage continues to deteriorate [1,2]. Underlying medical issues like obesity, heart disease, and upper respiratory infections can also contribute to more severe clinical signs [1,2].

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosis of tracheal collapse typically involves a combination of clinical signs, physical examination, and diagnostic imaging. The main diagnostic tools used include:

[1] Clinical history and physical examination: Veterinarians will assess the patient's symptoms, such as a characteristic "goose honk" cough, coughing when picked up or with pressure on the neck, difficulty breathing, and exercise intolerance. They will also perform a physical exam, which may reveal an abnormal respiratory sound or ability to palpate the collapsed trachea. [1,2]

[2] Radiography: Chest x-rays can sometimes detect tracheal collapse, though they may miss up to 60% of cases as the trachea is not always collapsed during the radiographic examination. Radiographs can also help identify the location and extent of the collapse. [1,2]

[3] Fluoroscopy: This real-time imaging technique allows the veterinarian to see the trachea during both inspiration and expiration, which can better identify areas of collapse. Fluoroscopy is more sensitive than radiography for diagnosing tracheal collapse. [1,2]

[4] Tracheoscopy: This procedure involves inserting a small camera (endoscope) into the trachea to directly visualize the airway and confirm the diagnosis. Tracheoscopy also allows grading the severity of collapse from I-IV. This is considered the gold standard for diagnosis. [1,2,3]

In summary, tracheal collapse is most accurately diagnosed through a combination of clinical history, physical exam, and advanced imaging techniques like fluoroscopy and tracheoscopy. These tools allow the veterinarian to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity, which guides appropriate treatment.

## Treatment Options

Tracheal collapse is a progressive condition that can severely impact a dog's breathing and quality of life. While there is no cure, there are several treatment options that can help manage the condition and improve the dog's overall health.

Medical management is often the first line of treatment for mild to moderate tracheal collapse. This may include:

[1] Cough suppressants: Medications like butorphanol or hydrocodone can help reduce the frequency and severity of the cough associated with tracheal collapse. This helps limit further irritation and inflammation of the airway.

[2] Anti-inflammatory drugs: Corticosteroids, such as prednisone or fluticasone, can be used to reduce inflammation and swelling in the trachea. Inhaled steroids may be preferred to limit systemic side effects.

[3] Bronchodilators: Medications like theophylline or albuterol can help open up the airways and make it easier for the dog to breathe.

[4] Sedatives: Drugs like acepromazine or butorphanol can help calm the dog and reduce the stress response that can worsen tracheal collapse symptoms.

[5] Antibiotics: If secondary respiratory infections develop, antibiotics may be prescribed.

Lifestyle modifications are also important for managing tracheal collapse, such as maintaining the dog's weight, avoiding environmental irritants, and using a harness instead of a collar.

If medical management alone is not sufficient, surgical options may be considered for more severe cases of tracheal collapse. These include:

[6] Tracheal ring prostheses: Plastic rings are surgically placed around the outside of the trachea to provide external support and prevent collapse.

[7] Tracheal stents: Metal or plastic stents are inserted into the trachea to prop it open and prevent narrowing.

Surgery carries higher risks and complications, so it is typically reserved for dogs that do not respond adequately to medical therapy. Even with successful surgical intervention, ongoing medical management is usually still required.

The prognosis for dogs with tracheal collapse depends on the severity of the condition and the response to treatment. With appropriate management, many dogs can maintain a good quality of life, but the condition is progressive and will require lifelong care.

## Preventive Measures

To prevent and manage collapsing trachea in dogs, several preventive measures can be taken:

[1] Weight Management: Maintaining a healthy weight is crucial, as excess weight can exacerbate the symptoms of tracheal collapse by putting additional pressure on the airway.

[2] Environmental Control: Minimizing exposure to airway irritants such as smoke, dust, and strong fragrances can help reduce coughing and respiratory distress. Using a harness instead of a collar during walks can also prevent pressure on the trachea.

[3] Stress Reduction: Reducing stress and avoiding excessive excitement can help manage the symptoms of collapsing trachea. Creating a calm environment and using anxiety-reducing techniques can be beneficial.

[4] Vaccination: Some dogs may be prone to developing respiratory infections that can worsen tracheal collapse. Ensuring your dog is up-to-date on vaccinations, particularly for conditions like kennel cough, can help prevent these secondary complications.

[5] Regular Veterinary Checkups: Periodic veterinary exams can help monitor the progression of tracheal collapse and make timely adjustments to the management plan. This allows for early intervention and can slow the worsening of the condition.

By implementing these preventive measures, pet owners can help manage the symptoms of collapsing trachea and improve their dog's quality of life.

## Differential Diagnosis

The major differential diagnoses for collapsing trachea include:

[1] Chronic bronchitis - Chronic inflammation of the lower airways can result in coughing and airway narrowing, similar to tracheal collapse.

[2] Infectious tracheobronchitis - Infections of the trachea and bronchi can cause coughing and airway obstruction.

[3] Tracheal obstruction due to intraluminal disease or extraluminal compression - Masses, foreign bodies, or external compression from enlarged lymph nodes or other structures can obstruct the trachea.

[4] Elongated soft palate - An elongated soft palate can obstruct the upper airway and cause coughing.

[5] Endocardiosis and congestive heart failure - These cardiac conditions can lead to extraluminal compression of the airways and coughing.

[6] Pneumonia - Lung infections can cause coughing and airway inflammation.

To differentiate collapsing trachea from these other conditions, veterinarians will rely on a combination of signalment, history, physical exam, radiography, and potentially advanced imaging techniques like fluoroscopy or bronchoscopy. Identifying the primary location and extent of airway collapse is key to distinguishing tracheal collapse from other respiratory diseases.
