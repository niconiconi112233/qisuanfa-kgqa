## Disease Overview

Gastric dilation and volvulus (GDV) is an acute, life-threatening condition that primarily affects large- and giant-breed dogs. GDV involves an enlargement of the stomach associated with rotation on the mesenteric axis, leading to gastric distension, volvulus, and obstruction of blood flow. [1,2]

The exact cause of GDV is unknown, but several risk factors have been identified, including breed (e.g. Great Dane, German Shepherd, Weimaraner), advancing age, lean body condition, and single daily feeding. [1,4] Recommendations for owners of high-risk breeds include feeding multiple small meals, restricting exercise around mealtimes, and considering prophylactic gastropexy surgery. [1]

GDV has a high mortality rate, with 20-45% of treated animals not surviving. [1] Immediate medical stabilization and surgical intervention are critical to optimize the chances of survival. Key aspects of treatment include fluid resuscitation, gastric decompression, and surgical correction of the volvulus, often with gastropexy. [1,4] Postoperative complications such as cardiac arrhythmias and gastrointestinal dysfunction are common and require close monitoring and management. [1]

## Common Pathogens

Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) in companion animals is a multifactorial condition that is not caused by a specific pathogen. Rather, it is associated with several risk factors that can lead to the development of this life-threatening disorder [1,2]. The etiology of GDV is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic predisposition, anatomical factors, dietary factors, and stress [3,4].

Some of the key risk factors associated with the development of GDV in dogs include:

- Breed predisposition - Large and deep-chested breeds, such as Great Danes, German Shepherds, and Saint Bernards, are at higher risk [1,2].
- Age - Incidence increases with advancing age [2].
- Feeding practices - Feeding a single large meal per day, rapid eating, and use of elevated food bowls have been linked to increased GDV risk [5,6].
- Stress - Stressful events and a fearful temperament may also predispose dogs to GDV [7,8].
- Anatomical factors - Dogs with a deep, narrow thoracic conformation are at greater risk [2].

While no specific pathogens are involved in the development of GDV, bacterial translocation and sepsis can occur as secondary complications due to the compromised gastrointestinal integrity and ischemia associated with the condition [9]. Therefore, prophylactic antibiotics are often administered to prevent these complications.

In summary, GDV in companion animals is a complex, multifactorial disorder that is not caused by a single pathogen, but rather is associated with various genetic, anatomical, dietary, and environmental risk factors. Addressing these risk factors is crucial for prevention and management of this life-threatening condition.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Dogs with gastric dilation and volvulus (GDV) may present with a history of nonproductive retching, hypersalivation, and restlessness. Acute or progressive abdominal distention may be noted, or the affected dog may be found recumbent and depressed with an enlarged abdomen. [1]

Physical examination findings often include an enlarged or tympanic abdomen. Abdominal pain and/or splenomegaly may be appreciated on palpation. As the condition progresses to hypovolemic shock, signs can include weak peripheral pulses, tachycardia, prolonged capillary refill time, pale mucous membranes, and dyspnea. Cardiac arrhythmias may also be present. [1,2]

The expanding stomach can compress the thoracic cavity, inhibiting diaphragmatic movement and leading to respiratory distress. [1] In contrast to dogs, cats more commonly present with respiratory distress developed over 24 hours or more, rather than acute gastrointestinal signs. [3]

## Diagnostic Methods

### Clinical Examination
- Veterinarians will perform a thorough physical examination to assess the dog's vital signs, hydration status, and abdominal palpation. Signs may include restlessness, nonproductive vomiting or retching, excessive drooling, panting, abdominal distension, weakness, or collapse.

### Laboratory Testing
- Bloodwork such as a complete blood count, serum chemistry panel, and coagulation profile can provide important diagnostic information. 
- Point-of-care tests like packed cell volume/total solids, blood glucose, and venous blood gas (including lactate) may be more practical in an emergency situation.
- Elevated lactate levels can indicate poor perfusion and tissue necrosis, and have been associated with poorer prognosis.

### Imaging
- Radiographs, particularly right lateral abdominal views, are diagnostic for GDV. The hallmark sign is compartmentalization and craniodorsal displacement of the pylorus.
- Thoracic radiographs may also be obtained to evaluate for other comorbidities.

### Other Diagnostics
- Electrocardiography (ECG) can assess for cardiac arrhythmias, which are common in GDV patients.
- Abdominal ultrasonography is not typically needed to diagnose GDV, but may be useful to evaluate for free abdominal fluid or assess gastric wall integrity.

## Treatment Options

Immediate medical and surgical intervention is crucial for managing volvulus in small animals. The primary treatment approaches include:

[1] Fluid resuscitation and gastric decompression:
- Establish large-bore IV access and provide rapid fluid resuscitation with crystalloids at shock rates (90 mL/kg/hr) to correct hypovolemia
- Perform gastric decompression via orogastric tube or percutaneous trocharization to release accumulated gas and fluid

[2] Surgical correction:
- Perform laparotomy to return the stomach to its normal position and evaluate the stomach and spleen for signs of ischemic necrosis
- Remove any devitalized gastric or splenic tissue via partial gastrectomy or splenectomy
- Perform gastropexy to permanently adhere the stomach to the right body wall and prevent recurrence

[3] Postoperative management:
- Continue fluid therapy, analgesia, and gastroprotectants
- Monitor closely for complications like cardiac arrhythmias, gastric atony, sepsis, and reperfusion injury
- Provide supportive care and treat any complications as they arise

Timely surgical intervention along with aggressive pre- and post-operative stabilization are critical to optimize survival in patients with volvulus. Mortality rates can range from 10-33% despite appropriate treatment.

## Preventive Measures

To prevent the life-threatening condition of Volvulus in dogs, a multi-pronged approach is recommended:

Vaccination: Routine vaccination against known infectious causes of gastric dilatation, such as Helicobacter species, can help reduce the risk of developing Volvulus [1]. Keeping vaccinations up-to-date is an important preventive measure.

Isolation: Limiting stress and anxiety in dogs, such as avoiding boarding kennels or other high-stress environments, can help prevent Volvulus. Anxious dogs are more prone to developing this condition [2,3].

Environmental Management: Several dietary and lifestyle factors can reduce the risk of Volvulus:

- Feed smaller, more frequent meals rather than one large meal [2,4,5]
- Avoid using elevated food bowls, which may increase the risk [2,4,5] 
- Implement slow-feeding devices to discourage rapid eating [4,5]
- Restrict exercise for 1-2 hours before and after meals [2,4,5]
- Limit water intake immediately before and after meals [2,4,5]

By combining vaccination, isolation, and environmental management strategies, dog owners can significantly reduce the chances of their pet developing the life-threatening condition of Volvulus.

## Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating a patient with suspected volvulus, it is important to consider other conditions that may present with similar symptoms. Some key differential diagnoses include:

[1] Gastric dilatation alone: This condition involves gas and fluid accumulation in the stomach without the rotation or torsion seen in volvulus. It can be caused by factors like food bloat or obstruction. Radiographs can help distinguish simple dilatation from volvulus. [1]

[2] Splenic torsion: Torsion of the spleen can also cause abdominal distension and pain. Radiographic and ultrasonographic evaluation can help identify splenic involvement. [1]

[3] Mesenteric volvulus: This condition involves twisting of the small intestine around its mesenteric axis, leading to obstruction and ischemia. Radiographic and surgical evaluation are needed to diagnose. [1]

[4] Peritonitis: Inflammation of the abdominal cavity from causes like infection or trauma can present with similar clinical signs. Diagnostic tests like abdominal fluid analysis can help distinguish this. [1]

While rare, volvulus can also occur in small breed dogs and cats, though it is much more common in large and giant breed dogs. [1] Careful history, physical exam, and diagnostic imaging are key to differentiating volvulus from these other potential causes of acute abdominal distress.
