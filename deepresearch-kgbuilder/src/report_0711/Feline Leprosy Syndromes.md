## Disease Overview

Feline leprosy is a condition in which cats develop granulomas of the skin and subcutis associated with intracellular acid-fast bacteria that are difficult to culture using standard laboratory techniques. It is caused by several different mycobacterial species, including Mycobacterium lepraemurium, which was historically believed to be the sole cause, as well as other novel mycobacterial species.[1] 

Feline leprosy occurs more commonly in adult male cats with outdoor access, likely due to their increased risk of exposure through hunting and fighting.[1,2] The disease presents in two distinct clinical syndromes - a localized, aggressive form typically seen in younger cats, and a generalized, slowly progressive form more common in older cats.[1] Diagnosis relies on histopathology, cytology, and molecular techniques to identify the causative mycobacterial species.[1,2]

## Common Pathogens

Feline leprosy syndromes can be caused by several different mycobacterial species:

1. _Mycobacterium lepraemurium_: This is the most common causative agent of feline leprosy worldwide. It is closely related to _M. avium_ and causes a localized nodular disease, often affecting the head and limbs. The clinical course is typically aggressive, with a tendency towards local spread and recurrence.

2. Novel mycobacterial species: In addition to _M. lepraemurium_, a single unique mycobacterial species has been identified in some cases of feline leprosy. This organism is genetically related to _M. leprae_, _M. haemophilum_, and _M. malmoense_. Infections with this novel species tend to occur in older cats and have a more generalized, slowly progressive clinical presentation.

3. _Mycobacterium visibilis_: This slow-growing mycobacterial species has been identified as the causative agent of "feline multisystemic granulomatous mycobacteriosis" in cats from western Canada and the USA. It leads to diffuse cutaneous lesions and widespread systemic dissemination.

4. Other mycobacterial species: Occasionally, other mycobacterial pathogens such as _M. avium_, _M. bovis_, or _M. microti_ may also be involved in feline leprosy-like syndromes, though these are less common.

In summary, while _M. lepraemurium_ remains the most prevalent causative agent, feline leprosy is now recognized as a syndrome that can be associated with several different mycobacterial species, each with their own distinct clinical presentations.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

The clinical presentation of feline leprosy can be divided into two distinct syndromes:

One group consists of young cats (less than 4 years old) that develop localized, rapidly progressing nodular lesions typically on the limbs. These lesions can sometimes ulcerate. Cytology and histology reveal sparse to moderate numbers of acid-fast bacilli, often in areas of caseous necrosis surrounded by pyogranulomatous inflammation. In two cases, the causative organism was identified as Mycobacterium lepraemurium, while a different sequence was obtained in one additional case, and no PCR product could be obtained in the remaining case. The clinical course in this group was considered aggressive, with a tendency towards local spread, recurrence after surgery, and development of widespread lesions over several weeks. 

The second group consists of older cats (greater than 9 years old) with generalized skin involvement, abundant acid-fast bacilli on histology, and a slowly progressive clinical course. Most cats in this group initially had localized disease that subsequently became widespread, while a few had generalized disease from the start. The skin nodules did not ulcerate, and disease progression was protracted, taking months to years. Microscopically, the lesions consisted of sheets of epithelioid cells containing large numbers of acid-fast bacilli 2-8 μm in size. A unique 16S rRNA gene sequence was identified in six of seven cases tested, suggesting infection by a novel mycobacterial species.

## Diagnostic Methods

Feline leprosy typically presents with single or multiple granulomatous nodules in the skin or subcutis. The clinical presentation can vary:

- Young cats (< 4 years) often develop localized, rapidly progressing nodular disease affecting the limbs. The lesions may ulcerate and there are sparse to moderate numbers of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) identified.

- Older cats (> 9 years) tend to have more generalized skin involvement, with a multibacillary histological picture and a slowly progressive clinical course. Lesions do not typically ulcerate.

Diagnosis relies on identification of the mycobacterial organisms. Cytology or histopathology of lesions can demonstrate the presence of AFB, either as sparse to moderate numbers (in the tuberculoid form) or as large numbers within macrophages (in the lepromatous form). 

Molecular testing such as PCR can be used to identify the specific mycobacterial species involved. This is important, as feline leprosy is now known to be caused by at least two distinct mycobacterial species - Mycobacterium lepraemurium and a novel mycobacterial species more closely related to M. leprae.

Culture of the organisms is challenging, as the causative mycobacteria are slow-growing and fastidious. However, in some cases a slow, pure growth of mycobacteria has been obtained on specialized media.

In summary, the key diagnostic approaches for feline leprosy include:

- Cytology/histopathology to identify AFB and the histological pattern (tuberculoid vs. lepromatous)
- PCR to speciate the mycobacterial organism
- Culture, although this is difficult due to the fastidious nature of the causative agents

## Treatment Options

Feline leprosy caused by _Mycobacterium lepraemurium_ is typically treated with a combination of surgical resection of lesions and adjunctive medical therapy. The most common treatment approach involves using a combination of oral clarithromycin (62.5 mg per cat every 12 hours) and rifampicin (10-15 mg/kg once daily) for at least 2 months after clinical resolution [1]. Some cases may also benefit from the addition of oral clofazimine (25-50 mg per cat once daily or every other day) [1]. 

The concurrent use of multiple anti-mycobacterial agents is recommended to reduce the risk of developing drug resistance. In addition, wide surgical excision of early, localized infections may be helpful, though lesions tend to recur locally even with surgery [1].

For feline leprosy caused by the novel mycobacterial species identified in some cats, a similar treatment approach with clarithromycin, rifampicin, and potentially clofazimine has been reported to be effective [1]. However, definitive treatment guidelines for each of the causative agents have not yet been fully established.

## Preventive Measures

To prevent feline leprosy, the key recommendations are:

1. Keep cats indoors to avoid contact with wild rodents, which are a common source of infection for the causative mycobacteria species like M. lepraemurium [1,4]. 

2. Avoid environmental contamination by mycobacteria present in soil, water, or decaying vegetation, which can lead to wound infection and development of the disease [4,5]. 

3. For cats that spend time outdoors, check for wounds regularly and clean and disinfect any injuries promptly to prevent mycobacterial infection [5].

4. Given the potential zoonotic risk with some mycobacterial species, owners - especially those who are immunocompromised - should use gloves when handling cats with suspected mycobacterial infections or when taking and processing biopsy samples [2].

## Differential Diagnosis

The key points regarding the differential diagnosis for feline leprosy are:

[1] Feline leprosy is caused by multiple mycobacterial species, not just Mycobacterium lepraemurium. At least two other novel mycobacterial species have been identified as causes of feline leprosy. [1][2]

[2] Feline leprosy can present in two main forms - a lepromatous form with abundant acid-fast bacilli, and a tuberculoid form with fewer bacilli and more granulomatous inflammation. The form may depend on the host's immune response. [1] 

[3] Other mycobacterial infections in cats include tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, and opportunistic infections caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria like M. smegmatis or slowly growing mycobacteria. These tend to cause more localized skin/subcutaneous infections rather than the generalized granulomas of feline leprosy. [1]

[4] Diagnosis relies on visualization of acid-fast bacilli, culture, and molecular identification of the specific mycobacterial species involved. This is important, as the treatment approaches may differ for the different types of mycobacterial infections. [1][2]

# Feline Leprosy Syndromes

Feline leprosy is a complex condition caused by various mycobacterial species that can present in distinct clinical forms. While Mycobacterium lepraemurium was historically considered the sole causative agent, novel mycobacterial species have since been identified as contributors to this syndrome. Understanding the diverse etiologies, diagnostic approaches, and treatment strategies is crucial for effectively managing this challenging disease in cats.

## Conclusion

Feline leprosy encompasses two primary clinical syndromes: a localized, aggressive form typically seen in younger cats, and a generalized, slowly progressive form more common in older felines. Diagnosis relies on a combination of cytology, histopathology, and molecular techniques to identify the specific mycobacterial species involved.

| Presentation | Younger Cats (< 4 years) | Older Cats (> 9 years) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lesions | Localized, rapidly progressing nodules | Generalized skin involvement |
| Histology | Sparse to moderate acid-fast bacilli | Abundant acid-fast bacilli |
| Course | Aggressive, with local spread and recurrence | Slowly progressive over months to years |
| Causative Agents | Mycobacterium lepraemurium | Novel mycobacterial species |

Treatment often requires a combination of surgical resection and prolonged administration of multiple antimycobacterial agents to prevent drug resistance. Preventive measures focus on limiting environmental exposure and proper wound management to reduce the risk of infection. Ongoing research is needed to further elucidate the epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, and optimal treatment approaches for this complex feline disease.
