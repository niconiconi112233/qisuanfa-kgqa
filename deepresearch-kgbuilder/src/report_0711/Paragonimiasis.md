## Disease Overview

Paragonimiasis is a disease caused by parasitic lung flukes of the genus *Paragonimus*. The most common species affecting dogs and cats in North America is *Paragonimus kellicotti*, also known as the North American lung fluke [1,2]. 

These parasitic worms have a complex life cycle involving freshwater snails and crayfish as intermediate hosts. Dogs and cats become infected by eating raw or undercooked crayfish or other small animals that have ingested the encysted parasite larvae [2,3]. 

Once ingested, the immature flukes migrate through the body and eventually settle in the lungs, where they mature and form cysts in the bronchioles [2,3]. Infected animals may exhibit clinical signs ranging from a mild, intermittent cough to more severe respiratory distress, pneumonia, or spontaneous pneumothorax [2,4]. 

Diagnosis involves detecting the characteristic parasite eggs in fecal or respiratory samples. Treatment with antiparasitic drugs like praziquantel or fenbendazole is generally effective, but repeated treatments may be required in some cases [2,3,4]. While people can become infected by eating contaminated crayfish, transmission from pets to humans is not possible [4].

## Common Pathogens

The most common Paragonimus species that can cause lung fluke infections in companion animals are *Paragonimus kellicotti* and *Paragonimus westermani*.[1][2] *P. kellicotti* is endemic to North America, while *P. westermani* is distributed in Southeast Asia and Japan.[2] 

These lung flukes typically reside in cysts, primarily in the lungs of dogs, cats, and various other domestic and wild animals. Infection occurs when animals ingest raw crayfish or crabs containing the encysted larval stage of the parasite.[2][3] After penetrating the intestinal wall, the young flukes migrate through the diaphragm to the lungs where they mature.

In addition to Paragonimus species, dogs and cats can also serve as hosts for other types of lung flukes, though these are rarely found in North America.[3]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Dogs and cats with paragonimiasis can present with a range of symptoms. During the acute phase of infection, when the flukes are invading and migrating, affected animals may experience diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, cough, urticaria (hives), hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and spleen), and pulmonary abnormalities [1]. 

In the chronic phase, the main manifestations involve the lungs. Affected animals may develop a chronic, deep, intermittent cough, eventually becoming weak and lethargic [2]. Lung bullae (air-filled sacs) may form, potentially causing spontaneous pneumothorax (collapsed lung) [2]. 

Extrapulmonary infections, though rare, can lead to more severe clinical signs, especially when the brain is involved, causing seizures, aphasia (loss of speech), paresis (partial paralysis), and visual disturbances [3].

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosing lung fluke infections can be challenging, as the eggs of _Paragonimus_ species are often difficult to detect in sputum or feces samples. Serological tests can be helpful in confirming infections and monitoring treatment response [1].

Detection of antibodies to _Paragonimus westermani_ has been useful in differentiating paragonimiasis from tuberculosis, especially in Indochinese immigrants to the United States [1]. The complement fixation (CF) test has been the standard serological test, as it is highly sensitive for diagnosis and for assessing cure after therapy. However, due to technical difficulties with the CF test, enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and immunoblot (IB) tests have been developed as replacements [1].

While the IB assay using a crude antigen extract of _P. westermani_ has shown high sensitivity (96%) and specificity (>99%), it may not detect antibodies to other _Paragonimus_ species that can cause similar clinical manifestations in different geographic regions [1]. Therefore, the choice of serological test should consider the _Paragonimus_ species endemic to the patient's area.

In addition to serology, radiological imaging can assist in the diagnosis of paragonimiasis. Characteristic CT findings include subpleural or peribronchial nodules with low-attenuation areas, pleural thickening, and subpleural linear opacities [2-4]. These CT features can sometimes mimic pulmonary tuberculosis or lung cancer, emphasizing the importance of integrating clinical, radiological, and serological findings for accurate diagnosis [2,3].

## Treatment Options

Praziquantel is the drug of choice for treating paragonimiasis, with an adult or pediatric dosage of 25 mg/kg given orally three times per day for 2 consecutive days.[3] Alternatively, triclabendazole at 2 doses of 10 mg/kg given 12 hours apart can be used in patients 6 years of age and older.[3] In some cases, a short course of corticosteroids may be given with the praziquantel to help reduce the inflammatory response around dying flukes.[3]

For severe cases, lung lobectomy may be required.[4] Supportive care and nursing management are also important, as infected animals may develop complications such as bronchiectasis, hemoptysis, or spontaneous pneumothorax.[4]

## Preventive Measures

Preventing and controlling paragonimiasis in companion animals involves several key steps:

[1] Avoid feeding raw or undercooked freshwater crabs and crayfish. These can harbor the infectious larval stage of the Paragonimus parasite. Thoroughly cooking crustaceans to an internal temperature of at least 145°F (63°C) will kill any parasites present. [1]

[2] Prevent predation and scavenging by confining dogs on a leash or in a fenced yard, and keeping cats indoors. This limits their exposure to infected rodents or crayfish that may harbor the parasite. [4]

[3] Encourage good hygiene practices, such as routine handwashing with soap and warm water. This helps prevent accidental ingestion of infectious parasite eggs or larvae. [1]

[4] Conduct regular fecal exams for pets in endemic areas and treat any positive cases promptly. Early detection and treatment can eliminate the infection before it causes severe respiratory disease. [3,5]

## Differential Diagnosis

Paragonimiasis may present with symptoms similar to other diseases that need to be considered in the differential diagnosis. Pulmonary tuberculosis and lung cancer are two conditions that can have overlapping radiographic findings with paragonimiasis [1,2]. Detection of antibodies to _Paragonimus westermani_ can help differentiate paragonimiasis from tuberculosis in some cases, especially in areas where both diseases are prevalent [2].

Additionally, other parasitic lung infections such as those caused by other _Paragonimus_ species may have similar clinical manifestations and require differentiation [2]. While _P. westermani_ is the most common species, infections with other _Paragonimus_ spp. can occur in different geographic regions and may not be detected by antibody tests specific to _P. westermani_ [2].

In summary, the key differential diagnoses for paragonimiasis include:

- Pulmonary tuberculosis
- Lung cancer
- Other parasitic lung infections caused by different _Paragonimus_ species

Careful consideration of the geographic region, clinical presentation, and appropriate diagnostic testing (e.g. serology, imaging, parasite identification) are important to distinguish paragonimiasis from these other potential causes.
