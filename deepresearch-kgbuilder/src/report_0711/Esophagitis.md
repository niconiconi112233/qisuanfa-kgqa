## Disease Overview

Esophagitis is inflammation of the esophagus, the muscular tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. In companion animals, esophagitis is most commonly caused by gastroesophageal reflux, where stomach acids pass into the esophageal canal and irritate the esophageal tissue.[1][2][3] Other potential causes include foreign bodies, certain medications, and underlying conditions like esophageal abnormalities or neoplasia.[5] 

The classic sign of esophagitis is regurgitation, but other symptoms may include ptyalism (excessive salivation), difficulty swallowing, pain, depression, and anorexia.[5] Diagnosis is typically done through endoscopy, which allows direct visualization of the esophageal lining and any associated problems.[5] Mild cases may resolve with supportive care, while more severe cases often require treatment to reduce gastric acid production, increase lower esophageal sphincter tone, and provide pain relief.[5] With prompt and appropriate treatment, the prognosis for animals with esophagitis is generally good.

## Common Pathogens

The most common causes of esophagitis in cats and dogs are:

1. Gastroesophageal reflux [1,2,3,4] - Stomach acid passing into the esophagus, often due to anesthesia, drugs, or chronic vomiting.
2. Foreign bodies [3,5] - Ingestion of irritating or caustic substances that can damage the esophageal lining.
3. Certain medications [5] - Such as doxycycline, which can irritate the esophagus.
4. Eosinophilic esophagitis [3] - An emerging primary inflammatory disease of the esophagus with a presumed allergic etiology.
5. Viral infections [4] - Like calicivirus in cats, which can also cause esophagitis.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Esophagitis, or inflammation of the esophagus, can present with a variety of clinical signs in small animals. The most common symptom is regurgitation, where food or other contents from the esophagus or stomach are returned through the mouth [1]. Other signs may include increased swallowing motions, pain, depression, loss of appetite, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), and even chronic cough [1,2]. 

In mild cases, the dog may only show minor signs such as occasional missed meals or excessive lip licking and swallowing [3]. However, severe esophagitis can cause so much discomfort that the animal is reluctant to swallow even water or saliva [2]. Brachycephalic breeds like pugs and bulldogs seem to have an increased risk of esophagitis, likely due to their predisposition for gastroesophageal reflux [1].

## Diagnostic Methods

Esophagitis is typically diagnosed through a combination of clinical signs, history, and diagnostic tests. Endoscopic examination is considered the most sensitive method to diagnose esophagitis and assess the extent and severity of lesions [1]. Reliable endoscopic criteria for diagnosis of esophagitis are still being established, but the esophageal mucosa is often found to be edematous, reddened, and bleeding [2]. 

Survey radiography is usually unremarkable, but the esophagus may appear dilated with gas or fluid, though this is a nonspecific finding [3]. Barium contrast radiography can be used to identify esophageal strictures, but it may miss partial obstructions [4]. Using barium mixed with food rather than just liquid barium is more likely to detect partial obstructions [4].

In cases of suspected Spirocerca lupi infection, diagnosis relies on positive fecal floatation and endoscopic confirmation of esophageal wall nodules or masses [3].

## Treatment Options

Esophagitis in cats and dogs is typically caused by gastroesophageal reflux, which can occur due to anesthesia, frequent vomiting, or lodged foreign bodies [1,3]. Treatment aims to eliminate the underlying cause and prevent further exposure of the esophageal mucosa to gastric acid [3,5].

Medical management includes prokinetic agents like metoclopramide or cisapride to improve gastric emptying and lower esophageal sphincter tone [3,5]. Gastric acid suppression with H2-receptor antagonists (e.g. ranitidine, famotidine) or proton pump inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole) is also important [3,5]. Sucralfate can provide barrier protection for the esophageal mucosa [3,5]. 

In severe cases, a feeding tube may be used to completely rest the esophagus and avoid further irritation from oral intake [3,5]. Systemic antibiotics may be needed if aspiration pneumonia is present [5]. The use of corticosteroids to prevent esophageal stricture formation is controversial [5].

Dietary management involves feeding small, frequent meals of a soft, easily digestible diet [3,5]. Pain relief with systemic analgesics may also be indicated [5].

For esophageal strictures that develop, balloon dilation or bougienage under endoscopic guidance is the recommended treatment [1,3]. Multiple dilations are often required.

In summary, a combination of measures to address the underlying cause, suppress gastric acid, protect the esophageal mucosa, and provide supportive care is the mainstay of managing esophagitis in cats and dogs.

## Preventive Measures

One important preventive measure against esophagitis is maintaining appropriate vaccination protocols for companion animals. National and international vaccination guidelines have been developed to provide advice to veterinary practitioners [1]. These guidelines define core vaccines as those that all dogs and cats should receive, as they protect against severe, life-threatening diseases with global distribution. For dogs, the core vaccines are those that protect against canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus, and canine parvovirus [1]. For cats, the core vaccines are those that protect against feline parvovirus, feline calicivirus, and feline herpesvirus-1 [1]. 

In areas where rabies is endemic, rabies vaccination should also be considered a core vaccine for both dogs and cats [1]. Vaccination protocols generally involve multiple doses of core vaccines given to puppies and kittens, with a final dose at 16 weeks or older, followed by a booster at 6 or 12 months [1]. This helps overcome interference from maternally-derived antibodies. Subsequent core vaccinations are then recommended every 3 years, as the duration of immunity is long [1].

In addition to vaccination, environmental management is important to mitigate esophagitis. Measures such as keeping the stomach as empty as possible using prokinetic drugs, and minimizing gastric acid secretion with acid-suppressing medications, can help prevent further gastroesophageal reflux and esophageal injury [2]. Overall, a comprehensive preventive approach involving both vaccination and management of gastroesophageal reflux is crucial to reduce the risk of esophagitis in companion animals.

## Differential Diagnosis

Esophagitis can present with a wide range of clinical signs, which can make it difficult to diagnose. Other diseases and conditions that may present similarly to esophagitis include:

1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): Like esophagitis, GERD can cause regurgitation, dysphagia, and vomiting [1]. Differentiating between GERD and esophagitis may require further diagnostic tests.

2. Esophageal foreign bodies: Esophageal foreign bodies can cause acute regurgitation, retching, and pain, similar to esophagitis [2,3]. Imaging or endoscopy is often needed to identify a foreign body.

3. Esophageal motility disorders: Conditions like megaesophagus or cricopharyngeal achalasia can lead to regurgitation and difficulty swallowing, overlapping with esophagitis symptoms [4,5].

4. Esophageal neoplasia: Esophageal tumors may cause progressive dysphagia, regurgitation, and weight loss, mimicking esophagitis [6].

5. Gastritis or other gastrointestinal diseases: Vomiting associated with gastrointestinal diseases can sometimes be mistaken for regurgitation due to esophagitis [7].

6. Systemic diseases: Conditions like myasthenia gravis or hypothyroidism can cause esophageal dysfunction and lead to regurgitation [8,9].

Differentiating these conditions often requires a combination of clinical history, physical examination, diagnostic imaging, and potentially endoscopy and biopsy. A thorough work-up is important to identify the underlying cause and guide appropriate treatment.
