## Disease Overview

Mediastinitis is an inflammation of the mid-chest area in dogs, usually caused by a bacterial infection or a fungus [1]. It is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that can spread and infect the bloodstream. Dogs often swallow inedible objects that can get stuck in the esophagus, puncture it, and lead to an abscess, pneumonia, or abnormal breathing [3]. 

Mediastinitis can also develop following a blow to the neck or chest, or a wound to those areas [3]. Symptoms include difficulty swallowing, drooling, vomiting, and lethargy [3]. Diagnosis involves various tests to rule out other possible causes. Treatment typically requires hospitalization, drainage of any abscesses, antibiotics, and sometimes surgery to remove foreign objects [3]. Ongoing monitoring of the dog's temperature, blood tests, and X-rays are important during recovery [3].

## Common Pathogens

Mediastinitis can be caused by various pathogens, including both viral and bacterial agents. Some of the common causative agents of mediastinitis in dogs and cats include:

[1] Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species are the most common bacterial causes, accounting for 60-80% of cases.[1] These gram-positive bacteria can contaminate surgical sites or spread from nearby infections.

[2] Streptococcus species and anaerobic bacteria may also cause mediastinitis, particularly in cases of descending necrotizing mediastinitis where the infection spreads from the pharynx or oral cavity.[4] 

[3] In diabetic patients, gram-negative enterobacteria like Klebsiella can be implicated as well.[4]

[4] Fungal infections, such as those caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, have also been associated with a granulomatous form of fibrosing mediastinitis.[13]

In summary, the most common pathogens causing mediastinitis in dogs and cats are staphylococci, streptococci, anaerobes, and in some cases, fungi. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic or antifungal therapy are crucial in managing this life-threatening condition.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Dogs and cats with mediastinitis often present with a range of clinical signs. Common symptoms include visible swelling or bulging in the chest area, difficulty breathing, coughing, lethargy, fever, and loss of appetite [1]. Some pets may also experience gagging, drooling, difficulty swallowing, and vomiting [2,3]. Swelling may extend to the head, neck, and front legs as the infection spreads [2,3]. 

The clinical signs are often related to the underlying cause of the mediastinitis, such as a foreign body obstruction, trauma, or infectious agent. If an abscess develops, it can cut off blood flow to the heart, leading to life-threatening complications [2,3]. Prompt veterinary care is essential to diagnose the underlying condition and provide appropriate treatment.

## Diagnostic Methods

To confirm a diagnosis of mediastinitis in pets, veterinarians typically employ a range of diagnostic tests and procedures. Laboratory testing often includes hematology and biochemistry panels to assess the overall health status and look for signs of infection, such as leukocytosis. [1] Imaging techniques are crucial, with thoracic radiographs used to evaluate the mediastinal area and detect any masses or abnormalities. [3,5] 

In some cases, advanced imaging like computed tomography (CT) scanning may be recommended, as it can provide more detailed information about the mediastinal structures compared to radiography or ultrasonography. [4] Visualization of the esophagus through barium swallow studies or endoscopy can also help identify potential foreign bodies or perforations that may be causing the mediastinal inflammation. [3]

Aspiration of the mediastinal mass or fluid, if present, for cytological analysis and culture can provide a definitive diagnosis. [1] This may involve the use of fine needle aspiration or even surgical biopsy in some instances. Measuring triglyceride levels in any pleural fluid collected can help differentiate between chylothorax and other causes of mediastinal effusion. [2]

Overall, a multimodal diagnostic approach combining laboratory testing, imaging, and potential tissue sampling is typically required to properly diagnose and characterize the underlying cause of mediastinitis in veterinary patients. [3,4]

## Treatment Options

The treatment of mediastinitis in dogs and cats involves a combination of medical, supportive, and surgical approaches. 

In acute cases, the primary goal is to address the underlying cause, such as a perforated esophagus or trachea. This often requires emergency surgery to repair the perforation and thoroughly lavage the mediastinal space. Intravenous antibiotics are also administered to control the infection [1].

For chronic or granulomatous forms of mediastinitis, antifungal medications may be prescribed if the condition is caused by fungal agents like Histoplasma, Cryptococcus, or Nocardia [1]. The combination of pleural lavage and antibiotic therapy has been reported to successfully resolve pyothorax (a type of mediastinitis) in up to 60% of affected cats and dogs [2].

In cases of mediastinal neoplasia, treatment options include surgical removal (if possible), chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. These patients often require regular visits for chemotherapy administration, and careful nursing care is essential to minimize stress and monitor for complications like pleural effusions [1].

Supportive care is crucial for all mediastinitis patients, and may include oxygen therapy, fluid management, and pain control. Thoracostomy tubes are commonly placed to drain fluid or air from the mediastinal space and improve ventilation [2].

In summary, the treatment of mediastinitis involves a combination of:

- Surgical repair of perforations
- Antimicrobial therapy (antibiotics, antifungals)
- Pleural lavage
- Supportive care (oxygen, fluids, pain management)
- Surgical, chemotherapeutic, or radiation treatment for neoplasia

## Preventive Measures

Proper prevention and management of mediastinitis in companion animals involves a multifaceted approach:

Vaccination: While there are no specific vaccines available to prevent mediastinitis, maintaining your dog's core vaccinations (such as those for distemper, parvovirus, and rabies) can help strengthen their overall immune system and resilience against infections [1].

Environmental Management:
- Avoid allowing pets to ingest foreign objects that could become lodged in the esophagus and lead to mediastinal infection [2].
- Promptly treat any respiratory infections or injuries to the chest area to prevent development of mediastinitis [1].
- Ensure good oral hygiene and dental care, as dental infections can potentially spread to the mediastinal area [1].

Prompt Veterinary Care:
- Seek immediate veterinary attention if you notice any signs of chest swelling, difficulty breathing, or other concerning symptoms in your pet [1,2].
- Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for successful management of mediastinitis.

By focusing on preventive measures, pet owners can help reduce the risk of their companion animals developing this serious condition. Regular veterinary check-ups, a safe home environment, and prompt treatment of any respiratory or dental issues are all important steps in keeping pets healthy and avoiding the complications of mediastinitis.

## Differential Diagnosis

The most common differential diagnoses for mediastinitis include infectious causes such as fungal or bacterial infections, as well as neoplastic processes like lymphoma or carcinomatosis.[1] Other potential causes include foreign body migration, pleural or pericardial effusions, and pneumonia.[1] While neoplasia (e.g. mesothelioma) is less likely, it should also be considered in the differential diagnosis.[1]

Concurrent imaging or laboratory findings may help prioritize the differential diagnoses. For example, FeLV-positive status in a young cat with a cranial mediastinal mass is most consistent with lymphoma.[2] Additionally, the specific location of a mediastinal mass can provide clues to the underlying etiology.[2]
