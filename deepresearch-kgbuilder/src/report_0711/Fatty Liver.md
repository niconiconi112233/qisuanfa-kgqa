## Disease Overview

Feline hepatic lipidosis (FHL) is a common and potentially fatal liver disorder in cats. The underlying pathogenesis is not fully understood, but it involves an imbalance between the influx of fatty acids from peripheral fat stores into the liver, de novo lipogenesis, and the rate of hepatic oxidation and dispersal of hepatic triglycerides via excretion of very-low density lipoproteins. 

FHL typically develops in overweight, middle-aged cats that undergo a period of acute anorexia and catabolism. Reduced caloric intake and protein-calorie malnutrition are important predisposing factors. The resulting rapid mobilization of peripheral fat leads to fatty accumulation in the liver. FHL has been reported from various geographic regions, including North America, Great Britain, Japan, and Western Europe, possibly due to feeding habits and high obesity rates in the feline population.

## Common Pathogens

Hepatic lipidosis, also known as fatty liver disease, is a serious liver condition in cats that is often secondary to an underlying disease or condition. The disease is characterized by a buildup of fat within the liver cells, which can severely impair liver function. 

Some of the common underlying causes and risk factors for hepatic lipidosis include:

1. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [1]: IBD can lead to poor appetite and weight loss, setting the stage for hepatic lipidosis.

2. Other liver diseases [1]: Pre-existing liver conditions like cholangiohepatitis, pancreatitis, and cancer can contribute to the development of hepatic lipidosis.

3. Diabetes mellitus [1]: Cats with diabetes are more prone to developing fatty liver disease.

4. Obesity and rapid weight loss [1,2]: Overweight or obese cats that suddenly stop eating are at high risk, as the rapid breakdown of stored fat overwhelms the liver's capacity.

5. Anorexia or inappetence from various causes [1,2]: Any condition that leads a cat to stop eating for several days, such as stress, nausea, or underlying illness, can precipitate hepatic lipidosis.

In the majority of cases, hepatic lipidosis is a secondary disease process rather than a primary liver condition [3,4]. The underlying trigger for anorexia and weight loss is the key factor that sets the stage for the development of fatty liver syndrome in cats.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Cats with hepatic lipidosis typically present with a range of clinical symptoms and signs. The most common include:

[1] Dramatic weight loss, often greater than 25% of the cat's body weight. This rapid weight loss can include dehydration deficits.

[2] Variable lethargy and weakness. Cats may appear lethargic and lack energy.

[3] Vomiting and ptyalism (excessive salivation). Nausea is common in cats with hepatic lipidosis.

[4] Pallor, potentially due to anemia or jaundice. The cat's mucous membranes may appear pale.

[5] Neck ventriflexion, or bending of the neck toward the chest. This can be a sign of severe electrolyte imbalances or thiamine deficiency.

[6] Hepatomegaly, or enlargement of the liver, which may be detectable on physical exam.

[7] Jaundice, or a yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, and whites of the eyes. This is due to hyperbilirubinemia.

[8] Gastroparesis and intestinal ileus, causing reduced gastrointestinal motility. This can be secondary to electrolyte abnormalities.

[9] Diarrhea may be present, especially if the cat has an underlying condition like inflammatory bowel disease or lymphoma.

[10] Ptyalism may also be a sign of hepatic encephalopathy or nausea.

In summary, the key clinical signs of feline hepatic lipidosis are rapid and severe weight loss, lethargy, gastrointestinal signs like vomiting and ptyalism, and potential neurological symptoms like neck ventriflexion - all of which are related to the disruption in liver function and metabolism caused by the fatty liver disease. Early recognition of these signs is critical for prompt treatment.

## Diagnostic Methods

Veterinarians use a combination of clinical signs, laboratory testing, and imaging to diagnose fatty liver disease (hepatic lipidosis) in cats. 

The main diagnostic methods include:

[1] Clinical presentation: Cats with hepatic lipidosis often present with symptoms such as poor appetite, rapid weight loss, jaundice, vomiting, lethargy, and unusual behaviors. These clinical signs can help point to the underlying liver disease.

[2] Laboratory testing: Blood tests are used to assess liver function and detect abnormalities. Common findings include high bilirubin, elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP), and electrolyte imbalances like hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia. [2]

[3] Abdominal ultrasound: This imaging technique is very useful for diagnosing hepatic lipidosis. The liver typically appears diffusely hyperechoic (increased echogenicity) compared to normal liver tissue, with poor visualization of blood vessels and increased attenuation of the ultrasound beam. [1][3][4]

[4] Liver biopsy or fine needle aspiration: While not always necessary, collecting a sample of liver tissue can confirm the diagnosis of hepatic lipidosis. Cytology would show the liver cells are filled with fat vacuoles. [1]

In some cases, a presumptive diagnosis can be made based on the history, clinical signs, and supportive laboratory and ultrasound findings, without requiring a liver biopsy. However, additional testing may be needed if the cat's condition does not improve with treatment. [1]

## Treatment Options

The cornerstone of treating feline hepatic lipidosis is providing aggressive nutritional support until the cat's normal appetite returns. This typically requires the use of a feeding tube, such as an esophagostomy or gastrostomy tube, to ensure the cat receives the necessary calories, protein, and nutrients [1]. 

Cats with hepatic lipidosis often have electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, that must be corrected through supplementation [1,2]. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies, including vitamin K, B12, and glutathione, are also common and require supplementation [1,2,3]. 

Medications may be used to manage symptoms, such as anti-nausea drugs to decrease vomiting and improve appetite [1]. Ursodeoxycholic acid, antioxidants, and other supplements have also been recommended, though their efficacy is less established [3].

Addressing any underlying medical condition that precipitated the anorexia and hepatic lipidosis is also essential for full recovery [1,2]. With aggressive nutritional support and management of complications, the prognosis for cats with hepatic lipidosis is reasonably good, with survival rates around 75-80% reported [2].

## Preventive Measures

To prevent the development of fatty liver disease in cats, several steps can be taken:

1. Maintain a healthy body weight for your cat. Overweight and obese cats are at higher risk for fatty liver disease, so work with your veterinarian to ensure your cat is at an ideal body condition [1]. Gradual weight loss through diet and exercise can help reduce the risk.

2. Monitor your cat's food intake closely. A sudden decrease or loss of appetite can quickly lead to fatty liver disease [1]. If your cat's eating habits change, contact your vet right away.

3. Introduce diet changes slowly. Sudden changes to your cat's food can upset their digestive system and cause them to stop eating, increasing the risk of fatty liver disease [1]. Transition to a new food gradually over 1-2 weeks.

4. Minimize stress on your cat. Stressful events like moving, introducing a new pet, or the loss of a family member can cause a cat to stop eating and develop fatty liver disease [1]. Try to maintain a stable, low-stress environment for your cat.

5. Keep your cat up to date on veterinary care. Regular checkups allow your vet to monitor for any underlying conditions that could lead to fatty liver disease, such as diabetes, cancer, or kidney disease [1]. Prompt treatment of any issues can help prevent the onset of hepatic lipidosis.

## Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating a dog with potential fatty liver disease, it is important to consider other liver conditions that can present with similar symptoms. Some key differential diagnoses include:

[Hepatic Encephalopathy](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/dog-owners/digestive-disorders-of-dogs/disorders-of-the-liver-and-gallbladder-in-dogs#v3202051): This neurological condition is caused by the liver's inability to properly metabolize and remove toxins from the bloodstream. Symptoms can include disorientation, seizures, and coma.

[Portosystemic Shunts](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/dog-owners/digestive-disorders-of-dogs/disorders-of-the-liver-and-gallbladder-in-dogs#v3202039): Congenital or acquired abnormal blood vessels that bypass the liver, leading to accumulation of toxins and liver dysfunction.

[Chronic Hepatitis](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/dog-owners/digestive-disorders-of-dogs/disorders-of-the-liver-and-gallbladder-in-dogs#v3202046): Long-term inflammation of the liver, which can be caused by a variety of factors including copper or iron accumulation, viral infections, or unknown causes.

[Liver Cancer](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/dog-owners/digestive-disorders-of-dogs/disorders-of-the-liver-and-gallbladder-in-dogs#v3202057): Primary liver tumors or metastatic cancer from other sites can lead to liver dysfunction.

[Liver Cysts and Nodular Hyperplasia](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/dog-owners/digestive-disorders-of-dogs/disorders-of-the-liver-and-gallbladder-in-dogs#v3202054): Benign growths or accumulations in the liver that may or may not affect liver function.

[Glycogen Storage Disease](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/dog-owners/digestive-disorders-of-dogs/disorders-of-the-liver-and-gallbladder-in-dogs#v3202055): Inherited enzyme deficiencies that lead to abnormal glycogen accumulation in the liver.

Differentiating these conditions often requires laboratory tests, imaging, and potentially liver biopsy. The veterinarian will need to carefully evaluate the dog's history, clinical signs, and diagnostic test results to arrive at the correct diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan.

# Pet Disease: Fatty Liver

Feline hepatic lipidosis, or fatty liver disease, is a common and potentially fatal liver disorder in cats. The underlying causes often involve an imbalance between fat influx, synthesis, and metabolism in the liver, typically triggered by periods of acute anorexia and catabolism. Early recognition of the key clinical signs - rapid weight loss, lethargy, gastrointestinal issues, and neurological symptoms - is critical for prompt treatment. Aggressive nutritional support, electrolyte management, and addressing any underlying conditions are the cornerstones of successful feline fatty liver recovery.

## Summary

Maintaining a healthy body weight, closely monitoring food intake, and minimizing stress are important preventive measures for feline hepatic lipidosis. Differentiating this condition from other liver diseases like hepatic encephalopathy or liver cancer requires comprehensive diagnostic testing. With early intervention and proper treatment, cats with fatty liver disease have a reasonably good prognosis, with survival rates around 75-80% reported.
