## Disease Overview

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that primarily affects animals, including companion animals like dogs and cats. It is caused by spirochete bacteria of the genus Leptospira and can be transmitted to humans as a zoonotic disease.[1] Among common domestic animals, leptospirosis is most frequently recognized in cattle, swine, dogs, and horses.[1] Domestic cats can also act as reservoirs of the infectious agents and pose a risk of disease transmission to other animals and humans.[2] 

The prevalence of leptospirosis in dogs has been estimated at around 10% in some regions, with infected dogs potentially exhibiting clinical symptoms or acting as asymptomatic carriers of the bacteria.[3] Leptospirosis is considered a quintessential One Health disease, as it affects both human and animal populations and requires a collaborative approach between human and veterinary medicine to control and prevent the spread of the disease.[4] The presence of unconventional pet mammals in domestic environments can also contribute to the epidemiology of leptospirosis as these animals may act as additional sources of the zoonotic agents.[5]

## Common Pathogens

Leptospirosis is a disease caused by infection with Leptospira bacteria, which can be found in soil and water worldwide. [1] While there are many strains of Leptospira, the most common pathogens that cause leptospirosis in dogs and cats are Leptospira interrogans serovar Canicola and Leptospira interrogans serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae. [2]

In dogs, leptospirosis can have direct cytotoxic effects on platelets, leading to platelet destruction and de-adherence. [3] Additionally, leptospirosis can cause aseptic meningitis in affected dogs. [3] Cats can also develop acute kidney injury from leptospirosis, which may progress to chronic kidney disease. Lesions in the liver have also been reported in cats with leptospirosis. [1]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Leptospirosis is a serious bacterial infection that can affect pets, particularly dogs and cats. The clinical symptoms and signs of leptospirosis in pets can vary widely, but there are several common manifestations to be aware of.

Dogs affected by leptospirosis may exhibit symptoms such as lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, and changes in urination patterns, including polyuria (excessive urination), oliguria (reduced urination), or anuria (complete lack of urination) [1]. Fever, weakness, and depression are also commonly reported [2,4].

In cats, the symptoms of leptospirosis can include depression, runny nose, weakness, spontaneous cough, dark red speckled gums, and increased thirst and urination [3]. Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes) may also occur in both dogs and cats [4,5].

Early recognition of these clinical signs is crucial for prompt diagnosis and treatment of leptospirosis in pets, as the disease can quickly become life-threatening if left unmanaged.

## Diagnostic Methods

Leptospirosis in dogs can present with a range of clinical signs, including lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, polyuria, oliguria, or anuria [1,2,3,4,5]. Diagnosing leptospirosis can be challenging, as these signs are not specific to the disease.

The main diagnostic approach for leptospirosis involves serological testing to detect Leptospira-specific antibodies [6,7,8]. The microscopic agglutination test (MAT) is considered the gold standard, but newer ELISA-based tests are also available [7,8]. Additionally, PCR testing can be used to detect the presence of Leptospira DNA in clinical samples [6].

When interpreting serological results, it is important to consider the vaccination status of the dog, as vaccination can lead to positive antibody titers [9]. In cases of suspected acute infection, repeat testing may be necessary to detect a rise in antibody levels over time.

## Treatment Options

Leptospirosis in dogs and cats is typically treated with a combination of antibiotics and supportive care. The antibiotic of choice is usually doxycycline, administered for at least 2 weeks to clear the infection from the body [1,2,3,4]. Other antibiotics like enrofloxacin may also be effective [3].

Depending on the severity of the illness, affected pets may require hospitalization and intravenous fluid therapy to manage dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and other complications [1,2,4]. Supportive nursing care is also crucial, which may include monitoring vital signs, managing pain, and providing nutritional support [1,5]. 

In more severe cases, additional treatments like dialysis may be necessary to address acute kidney injury [5]. Vaccination is also an important preventive measure, as it can help protect pets from future leptospirosis infections [3].

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is a crucial preventive measure against leptospirosis in companion animals. Studies have demonstrated that commercially available vaccines can provide significant protection, with an overall efficacy of 84% against clinical disease and 88% against infection.[1,2] However, it is important to note that even fully vaccinated dogs can still contract leptospirosis, as the efficacy of bacterin vaccines is not 100%.[3]

In addition to vaccination, environmental management strategies are also essential in preventing the spread of leptospirosis. This includes controlling rodent populations, properly disposing of animal waste, and avoiding stagnant water sources that may harbor the bacteria.[4] Veterinary experts have also recommended that dogs should be vaccinated for leptospirosis annually, rather than every three years, to ensure optimal protection.[5]

## Differential Diagnosis

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic strains of the Leptospira bacteria. It can manifest with a wide range of clinical signs in dogs, making it an important differential diagnosis to consider [1]. Traditionally, leptospirosis has been associated with acute hepatic and kidney disease [1]. However, the clinical presentation can vary significantly, with some dogs exhibiting only mild, non-specific symptoms [2].

When evaluating a dog with suspected leptospirosis, other differential diagnoses to consider include acute kidney injury (AKI), pyometra, hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, and immune-mediated diseases [2,5]. In cases of chronic disease, such as abortions or weak puppy syndrome, conditions like canine brucellosis, canine herpesvirus infection, and distemper should also be ruled out [3]. 

Ultimately, a definitive diagnosis of leptospirosis requires serologic testing and/or identification of the bacteria in tissues, blood, or urine samples [4]. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is critical, as leptospirosis can be a life-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment.
