## Disease Overview

Staphylococcal infections, particularly those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP), are emerging as important pathogens in companion animals. [1] MRSA and MRSP are concerning due to their potential to cause severe infections that are challenging to treat because of their multidrug resistance.

Companion animals, including dogs, cats, and horses, can act as reservoirs and vectors for the transmission of these methicillin-resistant staphylococci between animals, humans, and the environment. [1] While MRSA infections in companion animals are less common than MRSP, both have been reported worldwide, with varying prevalence rates across different countries and regions. [1,2]

Genetic analyses have revealed important differences in the epidemiology of MRSA and MRSP isolates from companion animals. MRSA isolates from dogs and cats are often genetically indistinguishable from human hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) lineages, suggesting transmission from humans to pets. [1] In contrast, MRSP isolates from horses tend to belong to distinct lineages that are different from the predominant human HA-MRSA strains, indicating the potential for independent evolution and spread within the animal population. [1]

The zoonotic potential of these methicillin-resistant staphylococci, along with their ability to cause severe and difficult-to-treat infections, highlights the importance of continued surveillance and epidemiological studies to better understand the dynamics of MRSA and MRSP in companion animals and their impact on both animal and human health. [1,2]

## Common Pathogens

Staphylococcus bacteria is a very common bacterial genus that is widely distributed throughout the world. While the most famous Staphylococcus species in humans is S. aureus, dogs and cats are more commonly affected by other Staphylococcus species such as S. pseudintermedius, S. schleiferi, and S. hyicus.

Multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus, known as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRS), is a real problem for both humans and animals. The most notorious MRS strain is methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), which is difficult to treat due to its resistance to many antibiotics and virulence factors that allow it to evade the immune system. Fortunately, MRSA is not as commonly found in dogs and cats as it is in humans. However, other MRS strains like methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) are more prevalent in companion animals.

In dogs and cats, Staphylococcus infections most commonly cause skin conditions like folliculitis, furunculosis, boils, and cellulitis. These infections are usually secondary, meaning something has compromised the animal's skin defenses and allowed the bacteria to overgrow. The most common underlying cause is allergic skin disease, which weakens the skin's ability to fight off infection. Recurrent or chronic Staphylococcus infections in dogs are often linked to uncontrolled allergies. [1,2]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Bacterial skin infections, or pyoderma, are a common problem in cats. The most common bacterial cause is Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, although Staphylococcus aureus is also a frequent culprit [1,2]. 

The clinical signs of pyoderma in cats can vary but often include:

- Excessive scale or dander, especially on the lower back near the tail [1]
- Crusts [1]
- Small, firm bumps on the skin (miliary dermatitis) [1] 
- Hair loss [1]
- Redness [1]
- Open sores or ulcers [1]
- Blood and discharge from sores [1]
- Skin odor [1]
- Scratching, licking, or rubbing the skin (itchiness) [1]

The infection may be limited to the skin surface (surface pyoderma), extend into the epidermis and hair follicles (superficial pyoderma), or penetrate deeper into the dermis and subcutaneous tissue (deep pyoderma) [1,2]. Superficial pyoderma is the most common presentation in cats [2].

Severe or persistent pyoderma may indicate an underlying condition that is compromising the cat's immune system or skin barrier, such as allergies, endocrine disorders, or immunodeficiency [1,2]. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause is crucial to resolving the skin infection.

## Diagnostic Methods

To diagnose a staph infection, the veterinarian will typically perform a complete physical examination of the dog and may also conduct the following tests:

[1] Skin cytology - A simple test where a piece of clear tape is gently placed on a skin lesion and then removed. The tape is then stained and examined under a microscope to look for the round-shaped bacteria characteristic of Staphylococcus.

[2] Aerobic skin culture and sensitivity - This is considered the gold standard test for diagnosing a staph infection. A bacterial culture is grown from a sample taken from the skin, and then tested against various antibiotics to determine which ones would be most effective for treatment.

These diagnostic tests allow the veterinarian to identify the specific strain of Staphylococcus bacteria causing the infection, as well as its antibiotic susceptibility profile. This information is crucial for guiding appropriate antibiotic therapy and managing the infection effectively.

## Treatment Options

The treatment of staphylococcal infections in dogs depends on several factors, including the severity of the infection, the specific strain of bacteria involved, and the dog's overall health status. A multifaceted approach is often required, combining topical therapies, oral antibiotics, and supportive care.

### Topical Therapies
Topical treatments are an important first line of defense against staphylococcal skin infections. Medicated shampoos containing 2-4% chlorhexidine, such as TrizChlor® 4 or Douxo S3™ PYO, can help remove crusts and reduce bacterial counts on the skin [1,2]. Antimicrobial wipes, mousses, and sprays may also be used to supplement the shampoo. Topical antibiotics like mupirocin ointment can be applied to specific lesions, but these are generally less effective than the shampoos and sprays.

### Oral Antibiotics
When topical therapy alone is insufficient, oral antibiotics may be needed. Commonly used antibiotics include cephalexin, cefpodoxime, clindamycin, and potentiated sulfa drugs [3,4]. Resistance patterns must be considered, as methicillin-resistant strains like MRSP and MRSA are becoming increasingly common. Fluoroquinolones like enrofloxacin may be used, but high doses are required to prevent the development of further resistance [5]. 

### Supportive Care
Managing the underlying condition that predisposed the dog to the staphylococcal infection is crucial. This may involve addressing allergies, hypothyroidism, or ectoparasites. Bathing, maintaining a clean environment, and preventing self-trauma through the use of Elizabethan collars or anti-itch medications like Apoquel® or Cytopoint® can also aid in recovery.

In summary, a combination of topical antiseptics, systemic antibiotics, and supportive care are typically needed to effectively treat staphylococcal infections in dogs. Regular monitoring and adjustments to the treatment plan may be required, especially for recurrent or severe cases.

## Preventive Measures

To prevent staphylococcal infection in pets, several key measures can be taken:

[1] Maintain good hygiene practices. Regularly bathe dogs and cats, especially those with skin conditions, using medicated shampoos containing chlorhexidine or other antimicrobial agents. [1,2] Avoid contact with infected areas and wear gloves when changing bandages. [1]

[2] Prevent environmental contamination. Keep pets' living areas clean and disinfected, particularly if the pet has had a staphylococcal infection. This helps reduce transmission to other pets or family members. [1,2]

[3] Limit antibiotic use. Overprescription of antibiotics can promote antibiotic resistance, including to methicillin-resistant strains. Antibiotics should only be used when absolutely necessary and under veterinary guidance. [1,2]

[4] Screen high-risk pets. Pets that visit veterinary facilities, have had surgery, or have weakened immune systems may be more prone to staphylococcal colonization. Screening these animals and decolonizing if needed can help prevent spread. [1,2]

[5] Educate owners. Informing pet owners about the risks of staphylococcal infections, proper hygiene, and when to seek veterinary care is important for prevention. [1,2]

By following these preventive measures, the risk of staphylococcal infections in pets can be reduced. Careful hygiene, environmental management, and judicious antibiotic use are key to controlling the spread of these resistant bacteria.

## Differential Diagnosis

Staphylococcal infections in dogs and cats can present with similar symptoms as several other common skin conditions. It is important to differentiate staphylococcal infections from other potential causes.

Allergic skin disease is a common underlying condition that can predispose dogs and cats to recurrent staphylococcal infections. Environmental allergies, food allergies, and flea allergy dermatitis can all cause skin inflammation, itching, and secondary bacterial infections. These allergic skin conditions need to be properly managed in order to prevent repeated staphylococcal infections.

Demodicosis (mange) is another skin condition that can appear similar to staphylococcal infections, with hair loss, redness, and crusting. However, demodicosis is caused by an overgrowth of the naturally occurring Demodex mite on the skin. Diagnosis requires skin scraping and microscopic identification of the mites.

Ringworm, a fungal infection of the skin, can also cause lesions that resemble those of staphylococcal infections. Ringworm lesions are often more circular in appearance. Diagnosis is made through fungal culture or microscopic identification of the fungal organism.

Certain autoimmune skin diseases, like pemphigus foliaceus, can present with crusting and scaling similar to staphylococcal infections. However, these autoimmune conditions would not improve with antibiotic treatment alone.

In summary, the key differential diagnoses for staphylococcal infections in dogs and cats include:

- Allergic skin disease (environmental, food, flea allergy)
- Demodicosis (mange)
- Ringworm
- Autoimmune skin diseases

Proper diagnosis through clinical signs, diagnostic testing, and response to treatment is important to distinguish staphylococcal infections from these other common skin conditions in pets. Managing any underlying predisposing factors is also crucial to prevent recurrent staphylococcal skin infections.
