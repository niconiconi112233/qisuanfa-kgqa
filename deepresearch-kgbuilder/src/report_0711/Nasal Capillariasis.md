## Disease Overview

Nasal capillariasis, also known as nasal capillariosis, is a respiratory parasitic infection caused by the nematode parasite Eucoleus boehmi (previously known as Capillaria boehmi). This parasite primarily affects the nasal passages and sinuses of dogs, although it can also infect cats. [1] 

The life cycle of E. boehmi involves direct transmission, where dogs become infected by ingesting the parasite's eggs present in the environment. The adult worms reside in the nasal cavity and sinuses, laying eggs that are coughed up, swallowed, and passed in the dog's feces. [2] Infection rates tend to be higher in dogs living in rural areas frequented by wildlife reservoirs, such as foxes. [3]

Most cases of nasal capillariasis are asymptomatic, but some dogs may develop signs like sneezing, nasal discharge, and reverse sneezing. In severe cases, the infection can cause obstruction of the nasal passages. [2,4] Diagnosis is typically made by identifying the characteristic eggs in fecal samples or by visualization of the adult worms during rhinoscopy. Treatment involves the use of deworming medications like fenbendazole or milbemycin. [2]

## Common Pathogens

Nasal capillariasis in companion animals can be caused by several types of parasitic worms. The most common culprits are species from the genus *Capillaria*, including *Eucoleus boehmi* and *Eucoleus aerophilus*.[1,2,3] These parasites typically reside in the nasal passages and sinuses, where they can cause significant irritation and inflammation.

Another potential cause is the nasal mite *Pneumonyssoides caninum*.[3] These tiny parasites burrow into the nasal mucosa, leading to a persistent nasal discharge and other respiratory symptoms.

While viral and bacterial infections can also affect the upper respiratory tract, they are less common as primary causes of nasal capillariasis. However, secondary bacterial infections may develop as a result of the initial parasitic infestation.[3] 

Overall, the most significant pathogens linked to nasal capillariasis in pets are the parasitic worms *Eucoleus boehmi* and *Eucoleus aerophilus*, as well as the nasal mite *Pneumonyssoides caninum*.[1,2,3]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Nasal capillariasis caused by the parasitic worm Eucoleus boehmi is usually asymptomatic in dogs, with most infections causing no clinical signs [1,2]. However, in cases of heavier infections, dogs may develop chronic rhinitis with symptoms such as serous nasal discharge and reverse sneezing [1,2]. In rare instances, intracranial migration of the parasite's eggs has been reported, leading to seizures and meningoencephalitis [1]. 

Overall, the clinical presentation of nasal capillariasis is not specific, and the intermittent shedding of the parasite's eggs makes accurate diagnosis challenging [1,3]. Symptoms, if present, are typically related to the inflammatory response in the nasal passages and sinuses caused by the adult worms embedded in the mucosal lining [1,2].

## Diagnostic Methods

Nasal capillariasis caused by Eucoleus boehmi can be diagnosed through a combination of clinical presentation, laboratory testing, and other relevant methods.

Clinical presentation may include chronic rhinitis, serous to mucopurulent nasal discharge, sneezing, and reverse sneezing. In severe cases, epistaxis and impaired sense of smell have been reported [1,2].

Laboratory diagnosis is typically made by identifying the characteristic eggs of E. boehmi in nasal discharge or fecal samples. The eggs are finely pitted, barrel-shaped, and measure 54-60 x 30-35 μm. They contain a developing larva that does not entirely fill the egg [1,2,3]. 

Differentiating the eggs of E. boehmi from those of other capillariid nematodes, such as Eucoleus aerophilus and Trichuris vulpis, is important. E. boehmi eggs have a more asymmetrical shape and pitted surface compared to the smooth-shelled T. vulpis eggs. E. aerophilus eggs contain a single cell when passed, unlike the more developed embryo in E. boehmi eggs [1,3].

Molecular techniques, such as PCR assays targeting the mitochondrial cox1 gene, can also be used to confirm the identity of the parasite [4]. Additionally, visualization of adult worms during rhinoscopy or recovery of adult worms via nasal lavage can aid in diagnosis [1,2].

In summary, nasal capillariasis should be considered in dogs with upper respiratory signs not responding to antibiotics. Diagnosis can be achieved by identifying the characteristic eggs in nasal discharge or feces, with confirmatory molecular testing if needed.

## Treatment Options

Medication and supportive care are commonly used to treat nasal capillariasis in companion animals. For medication, ivermectin and fenbendazole have both been used effectively to treat this parasitic infection in dogs [1]. Milbemycin oxime has also been shown to be effective, with dogs treated at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg having no eggs recovered in their feces 6 months post-treatment [2]. Topical application of imidacloprid 10%/moxidectin 2.5% has also been used successfully, with resolution of clinical signs and no eggs found in feces 28 days after treatment [3].

In addition to deworming medication, supportive nursing care may be needed to manage symptoms like nasal discharge and sneezing. This can include maintaining good nasal hygiene, providing humidified air, and addressing any secondary infections. With appropriate treatment, the prognosis for dogs with nasal capillariasis is generally good.

## Preventive Measures

To control nasal capillariasis caused by Eucoleus boehmi, the following preventive measures are recommended:

[1] Routine deworming of dogs with effective anthelmintics. Ivermectin, fenbendazole, milbemycin oxime, and moxidectin have all been used successfully, though with variable outcomes.[1,2,3] Repeated treatments and monitoring of fecal samples are often necessary.

[2] Prevent coprophagia (eating of feces) in dogs, as this is a potential route of transmission. Careful management of the environment to reduce egg contamination is important.[1] 

[3] Perform regular fecal examinations to detect and treat infections early. This is crucial, as Eucoleus boehmi infections can be difficult to eliminate completely.[1,2]

[4] In endemic areas, regular deworming of wild canid populations (e.g. foxes) may help reduce the environmental reservoir of the parasite.[1]

[5] Nasal washing may be a useful adjunct technique to help remove adult worms and eggs from the nasal passages of infected dogs.[2]

By implementing these preventive measures, the risk of nasal capillariasis in dogs can be reduced. However, given the challenges in treating this parasite, a multi-faceted approach is needed to effectively control Eucoleus boehmi infections.

## Differential Diagnosis

Nasal capillariasis is a parasitic infection that can cause symptoms similar to other nasal and respiratory diseases. When considering a diagnosis, several other conditions must be included in the differential:

[1] Neoplasia - Tumors or growths in the nasal cavity or sinus can obstruct airflow and cause sneezing, nasal discharge, and other respiratory signs. [2]

[2] Tooth root abscess - An infection originating from a tooth can spread to the nasal passages and result in unilateral nasal discharge and nasal congestion. [2]

[3] Viral rhinitis - Viral upper respiratory infections, common in cats, can lead to nasal inflammation, discharge, and sneezing. [2]

[4] Fungal rhinitis - Fungal infections such as aspergillosis can cause chronic nasal disease with turbinate destruction and mucopurulent discharge. [2]

[5] Foreign body - An object lodged in the nasal cavity can cause irritation, inflammation, and unilateral nasal discharge. [2]

[6] Allergic rhinitis - Environmental allergies can trigger nasal inflammation and symptoms like sneezing and nasal congestion. [2]

While each of these conditions presents its own diagnostic and treatment challenges, recent advances in managing fungal rhinitis have improved outcomes for that condition in particular. Careful consideration of the differential diagnoses is crucial to arriving at the correct diagnosis and providing appropriate treatment for nasal capillariasis.

# Nasal Capillariasis

Nasal capillariasis is a respiratory parasitic infection caused by the nematode Eucoleus boehmi. While often asymptomatic, severe cases can lead to chronic rhinitis, nasal discharge, and impaired breathing in dogs and cats. Diagnosing this condition involves identifying the characteristic eggs in nasal discharge or feces, with confirmation through molecular testing. Effective treatment options include deworming medications like ivermectin, fenbendazole, and milbemycin oxime. Preventing transmission requires routine deworming, reducing environmental contamination, and managing wild canid reservoirs.

## Conclusion

Nasal capillariasis is a challenging parasitic disease that requires a multifaceted approach for effective management. Key diagnostic methods include:

| Technique | Usefulness |
| --- | --- |
| Fecal examination | Identifying characteristic eggs |
| Rhinoscopy | Visualizing adult worms |
| Molecular testing | Confirming parasite species |

While the prognosis is generally good with appropriate treatment, repeated deworming and environmental control are often necessary to fully eliminate Eucoleus boehmi infections in dogs and cats. Continued research and education are needed to better understand and prevent this neglected parasitic disease.
