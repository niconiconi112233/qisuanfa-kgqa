## Disease Overview

Neutrophilia is defined as an increase in the absolute numbers of circulating neutrophils, a type of white blood cell. In adult dogs and cats, the normal neutrophil count typically ranges from 12,000 to 13,000 cells per microliter (μL) of blood [1]. Neutrophilia is often caused by inflammation, and can lead to structural changes in the neutrophils themselves [2]. 

Neutrophils are the most abundant type of white blood cell in dogs, cats, horses, and camelids, outnumbering lymphocytes in healthy individuals [3]. However, conditions like leukocyte adhesion deficiencies in dogs (e.g., in Irish setters) can lead to abnormally high neutrophil counts, sometimes accompanied by hypersegmented neutrophils [4]. Severe neutrophilia, characterized by very high neutrophil levels, may also be associated with other underlying health issues, such as poorly regenerative anemia and toxic changes [5].

## Common Pathogens

Neutrophilia, an increase in the number of neutrophils in the bloodstream, is often caused by inflammation due to various viral, bacterial, and other infectious agents in companion animals [1]. Some of the main causes of neutrophilia include:

Bacterial infections: Pyometra (uterine infection), pleuritis/pyothorax (chest cavity infection), peritonitis (abdominal cavity infection), and other localized suppurative (pus-forming) processes [2]. These chronic, closed cavity infections can lead to significant neutrophilia, often exceeding 25,000 neutrophils/μL [3].

Viral infections: Viral illnesses can also trigger neutrophilia as part of the body's immune response [4]. The extent of neutrophilia depends on the severity of the viral infection.

Other causes: Neutrophilia can also arise from non-infectious causes, such as immune-mediated diseases, neoplasia (cancer), and tissue trauma or necrosis [5]. In these cases, the neutrophilia is a reactive response to the underlying condition.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Neutrophilia, an abnormally high number of neutrophils in the blood, is a common clinical finding in dogs and cats. The typical presentation includes signs of an underlying inflammatory or infectious condition [1]. 

Affected animals often exhibit moderate to marked leukocytosis, with a high proportion of neutrophils [3]. There may be evidence of toxic changes in the neutrophils, indicating a severe inflammatory response [1]. In the acute stage, the neutrophilia is usually mild to moderate, with a corresponding left shift (immature neutrophils) [3].

Recurring or persistent bacterial infections are commonly observed in animals with neutrophilia [5]. Other potential signs include anemia, bleeding, and overwhelming infections [2]. The underlying cause could be an infection, sterile inflammation (e.g., immune-mediated disease, neoplasia, tissue trauma), or other conditions that trigger an acute inflammatory response [4].

## Diagnostic Methods

Neutrophilia, defined as an increase in the absolute number of circulating neutrophils, is a common finding in pets. [1] In adult dogs and cats, neutrophil counts exceeding 12,000-13,000 cells/μL are considered neutrophilic. [1] This elevated neutrophil count can be associated with various underlying conditions, such as chronic, closed cavity inflammatory lesions, which can lead to neutrophil counts up to 25,000 cells/μL. [3]

Diagnosing the cause of neutrophilia typically involves a comprehensive clinical examination, including a complete blood count (CBC) to assess the degree of neutrophilia. [2] Additionally, healthcare providers may order further diagnostic tests, such as biochemistry panels, imaging studies, or specialized tests, to identify the underlying disease process driving the neutrophilia. [3,4] In some cases, extreme neutrophilic leukocytosis, characterized by markedly increased granulopoiesis, may be observed. [5]

## Treatment Options

Neutrophilia, or an abnormally high number of neutrophils in the blood, is typically a symptom of an underlying condition rather than a standalone disease. The primary treatment approach is to address the underlying cause [1]. This may involve the use of antibiotics if a bacterial infection is suspected, though antibiotic use should be reserved for cases with clear evidence of infection rather than used as a blanket empirical treatment [2].

Supportive care, such as fluid therapy and pain management, may also be necessary depending on the underlying condition [3]. In some cases, medications that stimulate neutrophil production in the bone marrow may provide temporary improvement, but these are not a long-term solution [4]. 

The key is to identify and treat the underlying cause of the neutrophilia. Improving the overall health and immune function of the patient is crucial for managing the condition [5].

## Preventive Measures

Preventing or minimizing the occurrence of neutrophilia involves addressing the underlying causes. One key measure is vaccination, which can help protect against infectious diseases that can trigger neutrophilia [1]. Proper environmental management, such as maintaining a clean and hygienic living space for pets, can also reduce the risk of infections [2]. 

In cases of neutrophilia due to chronic inflammatory conditions, measures to control the inflammation, such as medication or dietary changes, may be necessary [2]. Additionally, regular veterinary check-ups and monitoring of the complete blood count can help detect neutrophilia early and allow for timely intervention [3].

In situations where neutrophilia is caused by leukemoid reactions, prompt treatment of the underlying condition is critical [1]. This may involve the use of medications that stimulate neutrophil production, but these are only temporary solutions and do not address the root cause [3].

## Differential Diagnosis

Neutrophilia, an increase in the number of neutrophils in the blood, can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions. In the differential diagnosis, several key diseases and disorders should be considered:

Leukocyte adhesion deficiencies, particularly in certain dog breeds like the Irish setter, are often associated with neutrophilia and hypersegmented neutrophils [1]. Additionally, inflammatory conditions - whether infectious or non-infectious (e.g. trauma, surgery, burns) - can lead to an increase in neutrophil counts [4]. 

Certain genetic and metabolic disorders, such as gangliosidoses, alpha-mannosidosis, Niemann-Pick disease variants, acid-lipase deficiency, and fucosidosis, have also been linked to neutrophilia [5]. 

It is important to thoroughly evaluate the patient's history, clinical signs, and diagnostic test results to distinguish the underlying cause of the neutrophilia and provide appropriate treatment.

# Pet Disease: Neutrophilia

Neutrophilia, an abnormal increase in circulating neutrophils, is a common finding in companion animals. This report synthesizes key information on the causes, clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, and management of neutrophilia in dogs and cats. Identifying the underlying condition driving the neutrophilia is crucial, as it may stem from infectious, inflammatory, or other disease processes. Comprehensive examination, laboratory testing, and targeted treatment are essential for effectively addressing this hematological disorder in pets.

## Summary

Neutrophilia is often caused by chronic bacterial infections, viral illnesses, or other inflammatory conditions. Affected animals may exhibit moderate to marked leukocytosis, with evidence of toxic changes in the neutrophils. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause, whether through antibiotics, supportive care, or managing the primary disease, is key to managing neutrophilia. Preventive measures, such as vaccination and maintaining a clean environment, can help minimize the risk of conditions that trigger neutrophilia.

| Consideration | Insight |
| --- | --- |
| Causes | Bacterial infections, viral infections, immune-mediated diseases, neoplasia, tissue trauma |
| Clinical Signs | Leukocytosis, toxic neutrophils, recurring infections, anemia, bleeding |
| Diagnostic Tests | Complete blood count, biochemistry panels, imaging studies |
