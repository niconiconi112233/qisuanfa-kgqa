## Disease Overview

Vacuolar hepatopathy (VH) is a common liver disorder in dogs characterized by the accumulation of fluid-filled cavities called vacuoles within the liver cells. The development of these vacuoles is often secondary to steroid treatments or increased levels of glucocorticoids produced by the body, such as in Cushing's disease. [1]

VH can also occur as a result of other underlying conditions like diabetes, hypothyroidism, or chronic illnesses that cause stress. In some cases, the cause is unknown (idiopathic). [2] VH is typically seen in middle-aged to older dogs, with Scottish Terriers having an increased risk. [3]

While many dogs with VH do not show clinical signs of liver disease, it can potentially progress to more severe liver damage and failure if left untreated. Key diagnostic features include elevated alkaline phosphatase levels and a characteristic "Swiss cheese" appearance on ultrasound. [1,3] Definitive diagnosis requires a liver biopsy.

The main treatment approach is to address any underlying causes, such as controlling diabetes or Cushing's disease. Dietary modifications, supplements, and medications like ursodiol may also be helpful. With proper management, the prognosis for many dogs with VH is good, though progression to cirrhosis is possible in some cases. [1,3]

## Common Pathogens

Vacuolar hepatopathy (VH) in dogs is not typically caused by specific viral, bacterial, or other infectious agents. Rather, VH is most commonly associated with the following factors:

[1] Steroid-related liver disease due to chronic use of steroid medications like prednisone, or excess production of endogenous steroids in conditions like Cushing's disease [1,2,4]

[2] Secondary to other underlying diseases or conditions that cause liver stress or damage, such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, cancer, immune-mediated diseases, neurological disorders, and chronic inflammation [1,2,4]  

[3] A breed-specific syndrome seen in Scottish Terriers, where the cause may involve abnormal adrenal steroidogenesis leading to progressive VH and increased risk of liver cancer [4]

In some cases, the cause of VH may be idiopathic, meaning the underlying reason is unknown [2,4]. Liver biopsy is often required to confirm the diagnosis of VH and rule out other potential liver diseases.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Cats with hepatic vacuolation, also known as feline hepatic lipidosis, often present with dramatic weight loss (typically over 25% of body weight) and variable symptoms such as lethargy, vomiting, increased salivation, pale appearance, neck ventroflexion, enlarged liver, jaundice, and gastrointestinal issues like gastroparesis and intestinal ileus. [1]

Severe electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, can lead to extreme weakness, muscle tremors, and neurological signs like head and neck ventroflexion. Coagulation abnormalities due to vitamin K deficiency may also occur, though overt bleeding is uncommon. [1]

Clinicopathologic findings often include a nonregenerative anemia, poikilocytosis, increased red blood cell Heinz bodies, and elevated liver enzymes (particularly ALP and bilirubin). Hypoalbuminemia, hyperglobulinemia, and severe electrolyte derangements are also common. Urinalysis may show lipiduria. [1]

Imaging tests like abdominal ultrasound typically reveal a diffusely hyperechoic liver consistent with the excessive fat accumulation. However, imaging alone cannot definitively diagnose hepatic lipidosis, which requires cytologic or histopathologic confirmation of the characteristic hepatocyte vacuolation. [1]

## Diagnostic Methods

Dogs with suspected vacuolar hepatopathy may display elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and modest increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT). However, other liver diseases can also cause similar enzyme changes, so further testing is often needed to confirm the diagnosis.

Clinical presentation, such as polyuria/polydipsia, lethargy, and possible weight loss, may raise suspicion for vacuolar hepatopathy, especially if the dog has been on chronic steroid medications. Abdominal palpation may detect an enlarged liver. 

Imaging techniques like abdominal radiography and ultrasound can provide supportive evidence. Radiographs may reveal hepatomegaly, while ultrasound may show a "Swiss cheese" pattern of hypoechoic and hyperechoic regions within the liver, although this appearance is not specific to vacuolar hepatopathy.

Definitive diagnosis requires a liver biopsy, either collected via ultrasound guidance or during surgery. Histopathology can identify the presence of vacuolated hepatocytes, which is the hallmark of this condition. Quantitative liver copper analysis may also be performed to rule out copper-associated hepatopathy.

Overall, a combination of clinical signs, laboratory testing, imaging, and liver biopsy is usually necessary to arrive at a diagnosis of vacuolar hepatopathy, especially since this condition can occur secondary to other underlying diseases. Close monitoring and treatment of any concurrent conditions is important in the management of this disorder.

## Treatment Options

Treating hepatic vacuolation involves a comprehensive approach to address the underlying causes and manage the associated symptoms. The key aspects of treatment include:

[1] Nutritional Support: Providing a high-calorie, high-protein diet is essential to reverse the fat accumulation in the liver. Feeding through a nasogastric or esophagostomy tube may be necessary in anorexic cats to ensure adequate caloric intake. Diets rich in protein (30-40% energy), moderate in lipids (50% energy), and low in carbohydrates (20% energy) are recommended.

[2] Fluid and Electrolyte Management: Cats with hepatic vacuolation often have electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, which require careful monitoring and supplementation. Intravenous fluids without dextrose are preferred to avoid exacerbating fat accumulation.

[3] Vitamin Supplementation: Vitamin K supplementation is crucial to address coagulation abnormalities. Vitamins B12, E, and S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) may also be beneficial.

[4] Medication: Anti-nausea medications, such as metoclopramide or ondansetron, can help manage vomiting. In some cases, corticosteroids may be used to control inflammation, but their use should be carefully considered.

[5] Supportive Care: Providing pain management, addressing any underlying conditions (e.g., pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease), and preventing complications like hepatic encephalopathy are important aspects of supportive care.

[6] Monitoring and Adjustments: Close monitoring of the cat's progress, including regular evaluation of liver enzymes, bilirubin, and electrolytes, is crucial to guide treatment adjustments and ensure a successful recovery.

With appropriate and timely intervention, the prognosis for cats with hepatic vacuolation can be good, with survival rates up to 80-88% reported in some studies.

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination and environmental management are important strategies to prevent hepatic vacuolation in dogs.

Dogs at risk for hepatic vacuolation, such as those with hyperadrenocorticism or on chronic steroid medications, should be monitored closely. Routine vaccination against infectious diseases can help prevent secondary liver damage.[1] Additionally, owners should work closely with their veterinarian to manage any underlying conditions that may contribute to vacuolar hepatopathy, such as diabetes or hypothyroidism.[2]

Environmental factors can also play a role. Exposure to toxins or hepatotoxic drugs should be minimized.[3] A diet low in bioavailable copper may be beneficial, as excess dietary copper is a common cause of vacuolar hepatopathy in certain breeds like the Bedlington Terrier.[4] Veterinarians may recommend copper-restricted diets or supplements like ursodiol to help manage copper-associated liver disease.[5]

Overall, a multi-pronged approach focused on identifying and treating underlying conditions, limiting toxin exposure, and dietary management can help prevent the development and progression of vacuolar hepatopathy in dogs. Regular veterinary monitoring is key to catching any issues early.

Here is a section on the differential diagnosis for canine hepatic vacuolation:

## Differential Diagnosis

An important consideration in the diagnosis of hepatic vacuolation is differentiating it from other diseases with similar clinical presentation. The main differential diagnoses include:

[1] Glycogen-type vacuolar hepatopathy: This is the most common form of vacuolar hepatopathy in dogs, often accompanying primary necroinflammatory liver disorders. It is associated with the accumulation of glycogen in clear vacuoles within hepatocytes. This can occur with steroid treatment, hyperadrenocorticism, or chronic illness.[1]

[2] Lipid-type vacuolar hepatopathy: Rare in cats, this involves the accumulation of lipids within membrane-bound vacuoles in hepatocytes. It can be associated with conditions like diabetes mellitus or idiopathic hyperlipidemia.[1] 

[3] Nonspecific reactive hepatopathy: Inflammatory/degenerative changes in the liver can occur secondary to systemic diseases affecting the splanchnic circulation. These changes are characterized by modest inflammatory infiltrates without obvious hepatocyte death, and are distinct from primary chronic hepatitis.[2,3]

The key is to rule out these secondary hepatic changes and focus the diagnosis on primary hepatic disorders like chronic hepatitis. This requires a comprehensive clinical assessment, diagnostic imaging, and ultimately liver biopsy for definitive diagnosis.

# Pet Disease: Hepatic Vacuolation

Hepatic vacuolation, a common liver disorder in dogs, is characterized by the accumulation of fluid-filled cavities within liver cells. This condition can stem from steroid treatments, Cushing's disease, or other underlying health issues. While many affected dogs show no symptoms, hepatic vacuolation can progress to severe liver damage if left untreated. This report compiles authoritative insights on the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this complex condition.

## Summary

Hepatic vacuolation is most often linked to steroid-related liver disease or secondary effects of conditions like diabetes and hypothyroidism. Definitive diagnosis requires liver biopsy, though imaging and lab tests can provide supportive evidence. Treatment focuses on addressing underlying causes, providing nutritional support, and managing electrolyte imbalances. With vigilant care, the prognosis is often good, though progression to cirrhosis is possible in some cases. Preventive measures include close monitoring, vaccination, and dietary management to minimize hepatotoxic exposures. By understanding the nuances of this condition, veterinary professionals can better support affected canine patients.
