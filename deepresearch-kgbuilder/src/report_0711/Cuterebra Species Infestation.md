## Disease Overview

Cuterebra species are opportunistic parasites that can infest dogs, cats, ferrets, and rabbits. The infestation is caused by the rodent or rabbit bot fly, which lays eggs that hatch when stimulated by the body heat of passing animals. The larvae then enter the host through natural openings like the mouth, nose, or wounds, and migrate to the subcutaneous tissues where they develop into mature larvae. [1]

The most common clinical presentation is a subcutaneous swelling with a central breathing pore, typically located around the head and neck area. These lesions are most commonly seen in late summer and early autumn when the larvae are enlarging. [1] Neurological disease can also occur when the larvae migrate through the brain, causing symptoms like seizures, blindness, and abnormal mentation. Respiratory distress can result from larvae migrating through the upper respiratory tract. [1]

Diagnosis is based on visual identification of the larvae, which can be challenging for younger stages. Advanced imaging like CT or MRI may be helpful, especially for neurological cases. Treatment involves surgical removal of the larvae, and antiparasitic medications may be used for migrating larvae. Controlling access to areas with rodent and rabbit burrows is important for prevention. [1,2,3]

## Common Pathogens

Cuterebra infestation is caused by larvae of botflies in the genus Cuterebra. These parasites can infect dogs, cats, rabbits, and ferrets, though pets are considered accidental hosts [1].

The Cuterebra life cycle involves adult flies laying eggs around rodent or rabbit burrows. When a pet comes in contact with these eggs, the larvae can hatch and enter the pet through the mouth, nose, or other openings, then migrate through the body [2]. 

While the most common presentation is a subcutaneous cyst or swelling, Cuterebra larvae can also migrate to the respiratory tract, eyes, or central nervous system, causing more severe disease [1,3]. Neurological signs like seizures, blindness, and abnormal behavior are reported more often in cats than dogs [3].

Overall, Cuterebra infestation is an important seasonal parasite that pet owners and veterinarians should be aware of, especially in areas with high rodent or rabbit populations. Prompt surgical removal of the larvae, when possible, is the recommended treatment [1,2].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

The typical manifestation of a Cuterebra infestation is a well-demarcated, soft, fistulous, subcutaneous swelling that most commonly appears in late summer or early autumn [1]. These lesions are typically found around the head, neck, and trunk areas of the affected animal. The first sign is often matting of the hair that the animal may be aggressively grooming, and inspection reveals a subcutaneous mass beneath a breathing pore [1].

Pain at the site of a Cuterebra lesion is variable and usually associated with secondary infections. Purulent material can exude from the lesion, and the most common differential diagnosis is an abscess or foreign body [1]. 

In addition to the cutaneous lesions, Cuterebra infestations can also cause neurological abnormalities such as seizures, blindness, abnormal mentation, and signs of unilateral prosencephalic disease [1]. One key historical finding in cats with neurological signs is an acute episode of violent sneezing weeks to months before clinical presentation [1]. Yorkshire Terriers may be at increased risk of Cuterebra infestation and can have a marked systemic inflammatory response or disseminated intravascular coagulation [1].

## Diagnostic Methods

Cuterebra infestation is typically diagnosed through physical examination findings. The presence of a fluctuant, subcutaneous swelling with a central breathing pore is highly suggestive of a Cuterebra larvae [1]. However, diagnosis can be more challenging when the larvae have migrated to other locations.

In cases where the larvae have reached the central nervous system or respiratory tract, advanced imaging such as CT or MRI may be needed to identify the parasite or its migratory tracks [1,2]. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has also been developed to detect parasite-specific IgG, which can aid diagnosis in cases without visible lesions [3]. 

For respiratory cases, examination of the pharynx, larynx and nasal passages under general anesthesia may reveal the presence of a larva [3]. Necropsy findings may identify intracranial or intraspinal larvae in cats with neurological disease [3].

## Treatment Options

Cuterebra infestations in pets typically require a multi-faceted approach:

[1] Manual removal of the larva: 
- The breathing pore or fistula should be carefully enlarged and the larva removed using forceps. 
- Care must be taken not to rupture the larva, as this can lead to a foreign body reaction and secondary infection.

[2] Wound management:
- The wound should be thoroughly flushed with sterile saline solution and debrided if necessary. 
- The wound is then allowed to heal by granulation, which can take weeks to months.

[3] Supportive care:
- Fluid administration, antimicrobials, and pain medication may be provided as needed.
- Corticosteroids have been used in cats with respiratory or neurological signs.

[4] Preventive education:
- Owners should be educated about the Cuterebra life cycle and risk factors to help avoid recurrent infestations.

### Key points
- Careful, complete removal of the larva is critical to avoid complications.
- Supportive care and wound management are important parts of treatment.
- Preventive education for owners can help reduce the risk of future infestations.

## Preventive Measures

Pet owners can take several measures to prevent Cuterebra infestation in their animals:

[1] Vaccination: There are no vaccines available specifically for Cuterebra, but maintaining pets' overall health and immune system through routine vaccinations can help prevent or reduce the severity of infestations.[2]

[2] Isolation: Keeping pets, especially cats, indoors or only allowing supervised outdoor access can limit their exposure to areas where Cuterebra eggs are laid, such as near rodent burrows. This is an effective way to prevent infestation.[3]

[3] Environmental management: Eliminating potential Cuterebra breeding sites around the home by removing piles of wood, leaves, or other debris can reduce the presence of adult flies and eggs. Keeping yards and outdoor areas well-maintained may also deter Cuterebra from laying eggs.[1,3]

In addition, year-round use of broad-spectrum parasite preventives, such as macrocyclic lactones or isoxazolines, may help kill Cuterebra larvae during migration before they can cause clinical disease, though more research is needed to confirm their efficacy.[2,4,5]

Overall, a combination of preventing outdoor access, eliminating breeding sites, and using preventive medications can help pet owners reduce the risk of Cuterebra infestation in their animals.

## Differential Diagnosis

The main differential diagnoses for Cuterebra infestation include other diseases that can cause similar clinical symptoms, such as:

[1] Abscesses or foreign body reactions: Subcutaneous swellings with central openings can be mistaken for Cuterebra lesions, especially if the larva has already exited. Careful exploration and identification of the parasite is required for definitive diagnosis.

[2] Neurological diseases: When Cuterebra larvae migrate to the central nervous system, they can cause seizures, blindness, and other neurological signs that may resemble other conditions affecting the brain and spinal cord.

[3] Respiratory diseases: Larvae migrating through the respiratory tract can lead to sneezing, nasal discharge, and dyspnea, similar to other upper respiratory infections.

[4] Ocular diseases: Larvae entering the eye can cause exudative uveitis, chemosis, and blepharospasm, which could be confused with other ophthalmic conditions.

Careful history-taking, physical examination, and advanced imaging (e.g. CT, MRI) can help distinguish Cuterebra infestation from these other potential causes of similar clinical signs. Definitive diagnosis requires identification of the larva.

# Pet Disease: Cuterebra Species Infestation

Cuterebra infestation is a seasonal parasitic disease affecting dogs, cats, rabbits, and ferrets. These opportunistic parasites enter their hosts through natural openings, migrating to subcutaneous tissues or even the central nervous system. Typical symptoms include subcutaneous swellings with a central breathing pore, as well as neurological signs like seizures and blindness. Diagnosis involves identifying the larvae, while treatment focuses on surgical removal and supportive care. Preventive measures, such as limiting outdoor access and eliminating breeding sites, are crucial to reducing the risk of Cuterebra infestations in pets.

## Summary

Cuterebra infestations can manifest through a variety of clinical signs, from localized skin lesions to severe neurological disease. Careful physical examination, advanced imaging, and parasite identification are key to making an accurate diagnosis. While surgical extraction remains the primary treatment, preventive measures like indoor confinement and environmental management are essential to protecting pets from this seasonal parasitic threat. By understanding the life cycle and clinical presentation of Cuterebra, veterinarians and pet owners can work together to limit the impact of this opportunistic parasite.
