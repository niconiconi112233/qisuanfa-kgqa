## Disease Overview

Feline bartonellosis is a vector-borne zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Bartonella henselae. It is a common infection among cats, with studies reporting an overall prevalence ranging from 15.1% to 16.4% in pet and stray cats [1,2]. The disease has a worldwide distribution, and the antibody prevalence in cats in Europe has been found to range from 3.6% to 53% [3,4,5]. Notably, the zoonotic B. henselae strain has been confirmed through sequencing, establishing cats as a reservoir for this pathogen that can also infect humans [1].

## Common Pathogens

Feline bartonellosis is primarily caused by the bacterial pathogen Bartonella henselae.[1] Cats are the main reservoir hosts for this bacterium, which they typically contract through flea bites.[2,3] Other Bartonella species, such as B. bacilliformis, can also cause infections in cats, though less commonly.[1] 

Bartonella species are small, intracellular gram-negative bacteria that inhabit the red blood cells of infected hosts.[4] When a cat is bitten by an infected flea, the bacteria from the flea's feces can enter the cat's bloodstream, leading to an infection.[2] Cats may experience a self-limiting fever or other mild symptoms, but can also become chronically infected without outward signs.[6]

In addition to Bartonella, other pathogens have been associated with feline bartonellosis, though their roles are less well-established. These include various viruses, bacteria, and parasites that may contribute to the complex clinical manifestations of the disease.[8,11]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Cats infected with feline Bartonella can exhibit a wide range of clinical symptoms. The most common signs include lethargy, decreased appetite, fever, vomiting, red eyes, and swollen lymph nodes [1]. In some cases, more serious symptoms can develop, such as neurological dysfunction and life-threatening cardiovascular diseases, although these are relatively rare [2,3]. 

Other reported symptoms associated with Bartonella infection in cats include muscle pain, joint pain, eye inflammation, and skin lesions [4,5]. The severity of symptoms can vary significantly, with many naturally infected cats showing no clinical signs at all [3].

## Diagnostic Methods

Feline bartonellosis, also known as cat scratch disease, can present with a variety of clinical signs. Many cats infected with Bartonella henselae do not show any symptoms [1]. However, some cats may develop life-threatening cardiovascular diseases such as endocarditis or myocarditis [2,3]. Other potential manifestations include fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and skin lesions [4,5].

Laboratory diagnosis of feline bartonellosis typically involves polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, bacterial culture, or serology [6,7]. PCR is widely accepted as a reliable method for detecting Bartonella DNA in tissue specimens [7]. Liquid blood culture can also improve the sensitivity of PCR detection compared to direct blood sampling [9]. Serological tests may be used, but their interpretation can be complicated by cross-reactivity between Bartonella species [8].

## Treatment Options

The treatment of feline bartonellosis, caused by the bacterium Bartonella henselae, typically involves a combination of antimicrobial medications and supportive care. [1] Doxycycline, often combined with pradofloxacin, is a common antibiotic regimen used to treat the infection, with a recommended duration of 4 to 6 weeks. [2,3] Other antibiotics such as amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, enrofloxacin, and rifampin have also been used, though the effectiveness may vary. [2,3] 

The goal of treatment is to reduce the level of bacteremia and alleviate the clinical signs associated with the infection. [3] Supportive care, including fluids, pain management, and management of any secondary complications, is also an important aspect of the treatment approach. [4] In some cases, the infection may be difficult to eradicate, and long-term or repeated antibiotic therapy may be necessary. [2]

## Preventive Measures

Feline bartonellosis, also known as cat scratch disease, is a zoonotic infection caused by the bacteria Bartonella. While there is currently no vaccine available to prevent this disease in cats [1], [2], there are other measures that can be taken to mitigate the risk of transmission.

Antibiotic treatment is not generally recommended for asymptomatic cats, as it has been shown to only temporarily suppress the bacteremia and does not eliminate the infection [2], [5]. Instead, efforts should focus on reducing the environmental exposure and transmission of the bacteria.

Proper flea control is crucial, as fleas are the primary vector for Bartonella transmission between cats [2], [6]. Additionally, isolating new or sick cats from healthy household pets can help prevent the spread of the infection [1], [7]. Proper disinfection of scratching posts, bedding, and other environmental surfaces can also reduce the risk of transmission [6].

While a vaccine for feline bartonellosis remains elusive, these preventive measures can help protect both cats and their owners from this potentially serious zoonotic disease.

## Differential Diagnosis

When diagnosing feline bartonellosis, it is important to distinguish it from other diseases with similar symptoms. Some key differential diagnoses include [1]:

Lymphoma, leukemia, and other neoplasms can present with similar skin lesions, fever, and lymphadenopathy. Fungal infections, tularemia, tuberculosis, plague, and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) may also have overlapping clinical features [2]. 

Additionally, diseases associated with immunodeficiency, such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) or feline leukemia virus (FeLV), can predispose cats to opportunistic Bartonella infections [3]. 

Pyogenic granuloma, hemangioma, and Kaposi's sarcoma are other conditions that can resemble the skin manifestations of bartonellosis [4]. Careful evaluation and exclusion of these alternatives is crucial for an accurate diagnosis.

# Feline Bartonellosis

Feline bartonellosis, also known as cat scratch disease, is a widespread zoonotic infection caused by the Bartonella henselae bacterium. Cats are the primary reservoir, with studies reporting an overall prevalence ranging from 15.1% to 16.4% in pet and stray cats. Understanding the common pathogens, clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods, treatment options, and preventive measures is crucial for effectively managing this disease in the feline population and mitigating the risk of transmission to humans.

## Conclusion

Feline bartonellosis is a complex and multifaceted disease that can present with a wide range of clinical symptoms, from mild fever to life-threatening cardiovascular complications. Accurate diagnosis often requires a combination of PCR testing, bacterial culture, and serological analysis. Treatment typically involves a course of antimicrobial therapy, such as doxycycline and pradofloxacin, along with supportive care measures.

While a vaccine remains elusive, preventive strategies focus on effective flea control, isolation of infected cats, and proper disinfection of the environment. Differentiating bartonellosis from other diseases with similar symptoms, such as lymphoma and fungal infections, is also critical for ensuring an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.

By understanding the nuances of this zoonotic disease, veterinary professionals and cat owners can work together to safeguard the health and well-being of feline companions while also mitigating the risk of transmission to humans.
