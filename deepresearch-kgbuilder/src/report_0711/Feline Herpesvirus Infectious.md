## Disease Overview

Feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) is a highly contagious virus that is a leading cause of upper respiratory tract infections in cats. FHV-1 is a member of the Varicellovirus genus in the Herpesviridae family and is closely related to other animal herpesviruses like canine herpesvirus-1 and phocine herpesvirus-1 [1]. 

Epidemiologically, FHV-1 behaves like a typical alphaherpesvirus. Most cats recover from the initial infection but become latent carriers that can periodically shed the virus, especially during times of stress [2,3]. Kittens are particularly susceptible and can become infected after losing maternal antibodies around 6-9 weeks of age [3]. FHV-1 is shed in ocular, nasal, and oral secretions, leading to transmission primarily through direct contact with infected cats [2,3].

Though vaccines are available, they do not prevent infection or the development of the latent carrier state. FHV-1 remains an important pathogen in cats, with studies estimating seropositivity rates up to 97% in some populations [2,3]. Ongoing research aims to better understand the epidemiology, genetic diversity, and evolution of FHV-1 strains to inform future prevention and control strategies.

## Common Pathogens

Feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) is a common viral cause of upper respiratory infections in cats. It is a highly contagious virus that is unique to cats and can be transmitted through direct contact with infected secretions or contaminated surfaces. [1] 

FHV-1 primarily affects the upper respiratory tract, causing symptoms like sneezing, nasal discharge, and conjunctivitis. Cats can become lifelong carriers of the virus after an initial infection, with stress or other factors potentially reactivating the virus and leading to recurrent illness. [2,3]

Another important pathogen is feline calicivirus (FCV), which also commonly causes upper respiratory symptoms in cats and can co-infect with FHV-1. FCV is a separate virus from FHV-1, but they are both major contributors to feline upper respiratory disease. [4,5]

Bacterial pathogens like Chlamydia felis and Bordetella bronchiseptica can also play a role in feline upper respiratory infections, sometimes complicating cases or causing chronic disease. [6,7] Cats in multi-cat environments like shelters or catteries are at higher risk of exposure to these viruses and bacteria. [8]

In summary, the main pathogens involved in feline herpesvirus infectious are:

- Feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) - a common viral cause of upper respiratory infection
- Feline calicivirus (FCV) - another viral pathogen that can co-infect with FHV-1
- Chlamydia felis - a bacterial cause of upper respiratory disease 
- Bordetella bronchiseptica - a bacterial respiratory pathogen in cats

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) is a common viral infection in cats that primarily affects the upper respiratory tract and eyes. The typical clinical symptoms and signs associated with FHV-1 include:

Sneezing, nasal discharge, and congestion: Cats with FHV-1 often experience nasal inflammation and discharge, as well as frequent sneezing. [1,2]

Eye discharge and conjunctivitis: FHV-1 can cause inflammation of the conjunctiva (the pink lining of the eye), leading to excessive eye tearing, discharge, and redness. [1,2]

Fever, lethargy, and anorexia: Cats with active FHV-1 infections may have a fever, feel lethargic, and lose their appetite. [1,2] 

Skin lesions: In rare cases, FHV-1 can cause inflammation and ulcers around the nose, mouth, and front legs. [2]

The incubation period for FHV-1 is typically 2-5 days, and infected cats can transmit the virus to other cats during this time, even before showing clinical signs. Once the symptoms appear, the active infection usually lasts 10-20 days. [1]

## Diagnostic Methods

Feline herpesvirus infections can be diagnosed through various methods, including clinical presentation and laboratory testing. The key diagnostic approaches include:

Clinical Presentation: Cats with feline herpesvirus often display symptoms such as sneezing, nasal discharge, fever, lethargy, and eye discharge [1]. Severe cases may also involve inflammation and ulceration of the cornea (keratitis) [2]. These clinical signs can help identify potential herpesvirus infection.

Laboratory Testing: 
- PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing is the most sensitive method for detecting feline herpesvirus DNA in samples such as conjunctival, corneal, or oropharyngeal swabs [3,4]. Positive PCR results should be interpreted with caution, as they may indicate low-level shedding or viral latency [5].
- Virus isolation can also be used to confirm active infection, but is less sensitive than PCR [6].
- Serological tests, such as ELISA, can detect antibodies to the virus, but do not differentiate between active and past infections [7]. 

It is important to note that cats recently vaccinated with a modified-live virus vaccine should not be tested, as the vaccine virus may be detected [8].

## Treatment Options

Veterinarians have several treatment options for feline herpesvirus infections:

[1] Anti-viral medications: Topical or oral anti-viral drugs like Famciclovir can help manage active infections and reduce symptoms. These medications target the virus and help control flare-ups. [2]

[2] Supportive care: Providing fluids, nutritional support, and cleaning the eyes and nose can help cats recover, especially in mild cases. Lysine supplements may also be given to boost the immune system. [1,2]

[3] Antibiotics: While antibiotics do not directly target the herpes virus, they may be used to treat any secondary bacterial infections that develop. [2,4]

[4] Hospitalization: In severe cases, cats may need to be hospitalized to receive intravenous fluids and intensive nursing care. This helps stabilize the cat during the most critical phase of illness. [2,4]

The goal of treatment is to manage symptoms, reduce viral shedding, and support the cat's overall health and recovery. With the right combination of anti-viral medications, supportive care, and treatment of secondary issues, most cats will recover from a herpes outbreak within 2-3 weeks. However, the virus remains dormant in the body and can reactivate, requiring ongoing management. [1,2,4]

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is a crucial preventive measure for feline herpesvirus infectious. The standard vaccination protocol involves two or three injections to greatly reduce the disease's severity. Feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) is a significant cause of upper respiratory infections in cats, and the vaccine protects them from this health risk.

Additionally, proper hygiene practices support health alongside immunization efforts. Cats should follow recommended vaccine protocols, which include two or three injections of the feline herpesvirus vaccine to diminish disease severity. Maintaining cleanliness is also essential to protect pets from this infectious virus.

Sterile immunity, which refers to the complete elimination of a virus from the body, is rare for feline herpesvirus. However, vaccinations play a critical role in reducing risks and lessening symptoms. Cats receiving the standard core vaccines are protected against feline viral rhinotracheitis caused by FHV-1, significantly decreasing the severity of disease manifestations like sneezing and eye issues.

Given the widespread presence of feline herpesvirus, vaccination against FHV-1 is crucial in managing the health risks associated with this infection. Vaccination efforts have shown positive outcomes by helping individual cats live healthier lives and enhancing herd immunity within communities, limiting the spread of FHV-1 infections.

## Differential Diagnosis

Feline herpesvirus infection causes eye and respiratory signs very similar to those caused by other viruses such as calicivirus. Ulcerative facial and nasal dermatitis and stomatitis in cats have also been associated with feline herpesvirus-1 infection [1]. Additionally, feline herpesvirus-1 can present as a striking eosinophilic dermatitis of the face and/or nasal planum that can be mistaken for allergic dermatitis [2].

Feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) is a highly contagious virus that is a leading cause of upper respiratory tract infections in cats. It is a significant pathogen, with studies estimating seropositivity rates up to 97% in some populations. Beyond FHV-1, other common causes of feline respiratory disease include feline calicivirus, Chlamydia felis, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Cats typically exhibit symptoms like sneezing, nasal discharge, fever, and eye issues when infected. Diagnosis relies on clinical presentation and laboratory testing, with PCR being the most sensitive method. Treatment involves anti-viral medications, supportive care, and managing secondary infections. Vaccination is crucial for prevention, as it greatly reduces disease severity, though the virus can still reactivate in vaccinated cats.

## Conclusion

Feline herpesvirus is a ubiquitous and challenging infection for cats, requiring a multi-faceted approach to management. Vaccination, supported by proper hygiene and environmental controls, is essential for limiting the spread and impact of this virus. However, ongoing research is needed to better understand FHV-1's epidemiology, genetic diversity, and evolution to develop more effective prevention and treatment strategies. With the right combination of clinical care and preventive measures, veterinarians can help cats live healthier lives despite the persistent threat of this common viral infection.
