## Disease Overview

Coccidiosis is a common intestinal disease in dogs and cats caused by protozoan parasites of the genus *Cystoisospora*. The disease is prevalent in young animals, with puppies and kittens being most susceptible. [1,2] 

Coccidiosis is acquired by ingesting sporulated oocysts from a contaminated environment or through the predation of infected intermediate hosts. [2] Clinical signs include diarrhea, weight loss, dehydration, and in severe cases, hemorrhage, anorexia, and depression. [1,2] However, many infected animals remain asymptomatic and simply shed oocysts in their feces. [1,2]

The prevalence of coccidia in dogs ranges from 3-38% in North America, with young animals at higher risk of developing clinical disease. [1,2] Feline coccidia, such as *C. felis* and *C. rivolta*, also commonly infect cats, though clinical disease is less common than in dogs. [2]

Proper hygiene and environmental sanitation are crucial for controlling coccidiosis, as the oocysts are resistant to many disinfectants and can survive for extended periods in the environment. [2] While several medications are used to treat clinical cases, many infections in adult animals resolve without treatment. [1,2]

## Common Coccidial Pathogens

Coccidiosis in dogs and cats is primarily caused by infections with various species of the genus Cystoisospora, formerly known as Isospora [1]. The most common species that infect dogs are C. canis, C. ohioensis, C. neorivolta, and C. burrowsi [1]. Cats are typically infected with C. felis and C. rivolta [1].

These coccidial parasites have a complex life cycle involving both asexual and sexual stages [1]. Infection occurs when dogs or cats ingest the infective sporulated oocysts from a contaminated environment [1]. The oocysts then release sporozoites that invade the intestinal epithelial cells, where they undergo asexual multiplication (merogony) and sexual reproduction (gametogony) [1]. The resulting oocysts are then shed in the feces, completing the cycle [1].

While coccidiosis is common in young animals, most infections in adult dogs and cats are asymptomatic [1,2,3]. However, severe clinical disease can occur in immunocompromised or stressed animals, particularly puppies and kittens [1,2,3]. The primary clinical sign is diarrhea, which may be accompanied by weight loss, dehydration, and in rare cases, hemorrhage [1,2,3].

Importantly, the coccidial species that infect dogs and cats are not transmissible to humans, as they are host-specific [1,2]. In contrast, the zoonotic protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, which can also be shed in feline feces, is a significant public health concern, especially for pregnant women [2].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Coccidia is a common microscopic protozoan parasite that can infect the gastrointestinal tract of dogs. While most infections in dogs are without clinical signs, coccidia can cause significant illness in some cases, especially in puppies.

The most prominent clinical sign of coccidiosis is diarrhea. This can range from mild, watery diarrhea to more severe, bloody or mucoid diarrhea. Other symptoms may include weight loss, lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, and dehydration. In severe cases, dogs may also exhibit abdominal distress and nervous system signs [1,2,3].

Puppies are much more likely than adult dogs to develop clinical signs of disease. Illness in kittens often occurs during the weaning period when they are under stress. In dogs, clinical signs typically develop about 2 weeks after initial infection [1,2].

Postmortem examination can reveal lesions in the intestinal tract, including reddening, mucus production, and villous atrophy. The various developmental stages of the coccidia parasite may be found within the intestinal epithelial cells and lamina propria [1].

## Diagnostic Methods

Coccidiosis in dogs and cats is typically diagnosed through a fecal examination. The veterinarian will collect a stool sample and examine it under a microscope to look for the presence of coccidia oocysts [1]. This test can identify the specific species of coccidia present.

In some cases, dogs and cats may not be shedding oocysts in their stool early in the course of illness, even after clinical signs have started. Repeat fecal testing may be needed to confirm the diagnosis [2]. Additional diagnostics such as bloodwork may also be required in severe cases of coccidiosis [2].

It's important to note that the presence of coccidia oocysts in the stool does not necessarily indicate clinical disease, as many animals may be asymptomatic carriers [1,2]. The veterinarian will consider the animal's clinical signs, history, and overall health when making a diagnosis of coccidiosis.

## Treatment Options

Coccidiosis is a common intestinal infection in dogs and cats, especially in young animals. While most cases do not require treatment, severe infections can lead to diarrhea, dehydration, and other complications.

For dogs with clinical signs of coccidiosis, several prescription medications can be effective. Sulfadimethoxine is the only FDA-approved treatment, given at 50-60 mg/kg daily for 5-20 days [1]. Other options include sulfaguanidine, furazolidone, and combination drugs like sulfadimethoxine/ormetoprim [1]. Triazine antiprotozoals like toltrazuril and diclazuril have also been used off-label with success [1,2].

In addition to medication, supportive care is important. Fluid therapy and a bland diet may be needed for dehydrated or anorexic animals [1]. Rigorous cleaning and disinfection of the environment is crucial to prevent reinfection, as the parasite's oocysts are hardy and resistant to many disinfectants [1,2].

For cats, treatment is similar, with sulfadimethoxine, diclazuril, and quinacrine as common options [1,2]. As with dogs, ensuring a clean environment and providing supportive care are key to managing feline coccidiosis.

Overall, while coccidiosis is common, most cases resolve without treatment. However, prompt diagnosis and appropriate medication, along with nursing support, are important for animals with severe clinical signs.

## Preventive Measures

Coccidia can be difficult to remove from the environment completely. Once oocysts sporulate into their infective stage, they are more resistant to disinfectants. Prompt disposal of feces is critical for prevention because the oocysts sporulate within hours after defecation. Any debris left behind must be removed or scrubbed with a degreasing cleaner.

Oocysts are hardy in the environment and can survive for several months in the right conditions, and can even survive freezing. Oocysts cannot sporulate at high heat temperatures >113Â°F, and steam cleaning can be used to clean contaminated surfaces. 

Preventing your dog from eating prey animals can also help avoid infection. Promptly removing fecal matter and sanitizing food and water bowls, dog runs, and kennels will help prevent coccidia in dogs. [1]

## Differential Diagnosis

Coccidiosis in dogs and cats can present with similar clinical signs as other gastrointestinal diseases, so a differential diagnosis is important. [1] The most prominent clinical sign is diarrhea, which can also occur with bacterial infections (e.g. Campylobacter, Clostridium, E. coli, Salmonella), viral infections (e.g. coronavirus, parvovirus, rotavirus), and parasitic infections like cryptosporidiosis. [1,2] 

Coccidiosis is unlikely to cause diarrhea in healthy adult animals, as the infection is often subclinical. Clinical signs are more commonly seen in young, stressed, or immunocompromised animals. [1,2] Severe infections with high oocyst counts can lead to weight loss, dehydration, and rarely hemorrhage. [1] However, these signs can also occur with other gastrointestinal diseases.

Definitive diagnosis of coccidiosis requires identification of the characteristic oocysts in the feces. This differentiates it from other causes of diarrhea that may not involve visible parasite stages. [1,2] Additional diagnostic tests like fecal cultures or blood work may be needed to rule out other possible causes.

# Pet Disease: Coccidiosis

Coccidiosis is a common intestinal infection caused by Cystoisospora parasites that can affect dogs and cats, especially young animals. While many infections are asymptomatic, severe cases can lead to debilitating diarrhea, dehydration, and other complications. This report explores the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of coccidiosis in companion animals.

## Summary

Coccidiosis is a widespread disease, with prevalence ranging from 3-38% in dogs and frequently infecting cats as well. Puppies and kittens are most susceptible, though adult animals can also carry and shed the hardy oocysts. Diarrhea is the primary clinical sign, but severe cases may involve weight loss, lethargy, and even hemorrhage. Definitive diagnosis requires microscopic identification of oocysts in fecal samples.

While many infections resolve without treatment, prescription medications like sulfadimethoxine can effectively manage clinical cases. Supportive care and rigorous environmental cleaning are also crucial to prevent reinfection, as the oocysts are resistant to many disinfectants. Preventing access to intermediate hosts and promptly removing feces are key preventive measures.

Coccidiosis presents similarly to other gastrointestinal diseases, so a careful differential diagnosis is important. Overall, this common parasitic infection requires vigilant management to protect the health of dogs and cats.
