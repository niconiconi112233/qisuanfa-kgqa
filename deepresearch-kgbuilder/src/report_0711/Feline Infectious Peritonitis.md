## Disease Overview

Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a viral disease of cats caused by certain strains of feline coronavirus (FCoV). The virus typically infects the gastrointestinal tract, but in a small proportion of cats, mutations allow the virus to infect and replicate within white blood cells, leading to a fatal immune-mediated disease [1]. 

FCoV is ubiquitous in most feline populations globally, with a seroprevalence of 15% in single-cat households and up to 90% in high-density environments like shelters and catteries [1,2]. However, only 5-12% of FCoV-infected cats will develop FIP [5]. Younger cats under 1.5 years old are at higher risk, as are purebred, male, and geriatric cats [1,3,4].

FIP can manifest in two main forms - an effusive "wet" form with fluid accumulation in body cavities, or a noneffusive "dry" form affecting the central nervous system and other organs [1]. Clinical signs are variable and may include fever, weight loss, neurological abnormalities, and ocular disease. Once clinical FIP develops, the disease is usually progressive and fatal without appropriate antiviral treatment [1].

Diagnosis of FIP is challenging, as there is no definitive test. A combination of clinical signs, laboratory findings, and diagnostic imaging or sampling (e.g. fluid analysis, biopsies) are typically required [1,2]. Recently, antiviral drugs have shown promise for the treatment of FIP, representing a major advancement in this previously untreatable disease [1].

## Common Pathogens

Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is caused by certain strains of a virus called the feline coronavirus (FCoV). There are two main forms of FCoV: the feline enteric coronavirus (FECoV), which is common and usually mild, and the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), which is much more dangerous and can lead to the development of FIP. 

The feline enteric coronavirus (FECoV) is a ubiquitous virus found in the gastrointestinal tract of many cats. Most cats infected with FECoV do not develop any serious symptoms, only experiencing mild diarrhea or upper respiratory signs that resolve on their own [1]. However, in approximately 5-12% of FCoV-infected cats, the virus can mutate into the more virulent FIPV form, which leads to the development of FIP [2]. 

The exact mutation that causes the transition from the benign FECoV to the deadly FIPV is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve changes in the 3c gene of the virus [2]. Two specific mutations in the spike (S) protein of the virus have also been linked to this biotype shift, though they are not the sole determinant [2]. Regardless of the specific genetic changes, the end result is a virus that can infect and replicate within monocytes and macrophages, enabling it to spread systemically throughout the cat's body [2].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a complex viral disease that can manifest in various ways. While many cats infected with the feline coronavirus may not show any obvious symptoms, those that develop FIP can experience a range of clinical signs [1].

The early stages of FIP are often characterized by nonspecific symptoms such as fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, and lethargy [1,2]. As the disease progresses, more specific signs may emerge depending on which organs are affected. Cats with the "wet" or effusive form of FIP often develop fluid buildup in the abdomen or chest, leading to a distended abdomen and difficulty breathing [1,2]. 

The "dry" or non-effusive form of FIP can cause inflammation and damage to the central nervous system, liver, kidneys, or eyes, resulting in neurological signs, jaundice, increased thirst and urination, or vision problems [1,2]. Seizures, tremors, and changes in behavior may also occur with nervous system involvement [2].

Overall, the clinical presentation of FIP can be quite variable, and many of the symptoms overlap with other feline diseases, making diagnosis challenging [1,2]. A combination of the cat's medical history, physical exam findings, and laboratory test results are typically needed to reach a presumptive FIP diagnosis.

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosing feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) can be challenging, as the clinical signs and laboratory changes are often non-specific. A multimodal approach is typically required to reach a definitive diagnosis.

Clinical presentation is key, with FIP commonly affecting younger cats under 2 years of age. Affected cats may exhibit an insidious onset of fever, malaise, and reduced appetite. Cats with the effusive ("wet") form may show abdominal distension or dyspnea, while those with the non-effusive ("dry") form may present with neurological signs or ocular abnormalities like uveitis or chorioretinitis. [1,2]

Routine laboratory findings that can support a diagnosis of FIP include mature neutrophilia, lymphopenia, non-regenerative anemia, hyperglobulinemia, and low albumin:globulin ratio. [2,5] Analysis of effusions, if present, is particularly helpful - FIP effusions are typically high in protein content (>35 g/L) with a low cell count (<5x10^9 cells/L) and a predominance of macrophages and neutrophils. The Rivalta test can help distinguish FIP effusions from other causes, though it lacks specificity. [2,6]

Definitive diagnosis typically requires detection of feline coronavirus antigen within macrophages, either through immunohistochemistry or immunocytochemistry on biopsy samples or effusions. [2,10] PCR testing for viral RNA can also support the diagnosis, especially when performed on effusions. However, PCR results may be variable, with false positives and negatives reported. [8,9]

In summary, a combination of clinical signs, laboratory data, and advanced testing (e.g. effusion analysis, PCR, immunostaining) is usually needed to diagnose FIP, as no single test is entirely reliable. Veterinarians must carefully interpret all available information to reach the most likely diagnosis. [2]

## Treatment Options

The treatment of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) has seen significant advancements in recent years. Previously considered a fatal disease, there are now effective antiviral medications available to treat FIP in cats.

The primary treatment options include:

1. Remdesivir: An injectable medication given under the cat's skin or into a vein. Remdesivir has shown promising results in treating FIP. [1]

2. Bova EIDD-1931 (the active form of Molnupiravir/EIDD-2801): An oral medication that has been used in clinical research studies and shown to be safe and effective for FIP treatment. [1]

3. GS-441524: An oral formulation of this antiviral compound has recently become available in the United States through a partnership between Stokes Pharmacy and the Bova Group. This medication has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective therapy for FIP in multiple clinical trials. [2,3]

The recommended treatment duration is typically 12 weeks to allow for full clearance of the disease. Cats with neurological or ocular manifestations of FIP may require higher dosages of the antiviral medications. [1]

Supportive care, such as maintaining hydration, providing adequate nutrition, and managing any secondary infections, is also crucial during the treatment process. Careful monitoring by a veterinarian is essential to ensure the cat is responding as expected and to make any necessary adjustments to the treatment plan. [4,5]

With the availability of these targeted antiviral therapies, the prognosis for cats with FIP has significantly improved, offering hope to affected feline patients and their owners.

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is a key strategy to prevent Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP), but the available FIP vaccines have limited efficacy. Multiple studies have shown that the currently approved FIP vaccine, Primucell FIP, has limited to no real-world efficacy, especially in multi-cat households or shelters [1]. 

The vaccine has been found to potentially cause antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), where the vaccine-induced antibodies can actually worsen the effects of the disease in some cats [2,5]. Researchers have developed a new mRNA-based FIP vaccine that targets internal viral proteins instead of the surface proteins, avoiding the ADE issue [4]. This vaccine is currently in development and seeking funding for clinical trials in kittens.

In the meantime, for cats at high risk of FIP exposure, the vaccine may still have some limited benefits if administered to FCoV antibody-negative kittens starting at 16 weeks of age according to the manufacturer's protocol [3,5]. However, the vaccine has not been shown to reduce FIP incidence in endemic catteries [5]. Routine vaccination is not recommended for the general pet cat population due to the low disease prevalence [5].

## Differential Diagnosis

Many important differential diagnoses should be considered in cats suspected of having FIP, such as toxoplasmosis, mycobacterial infection, and septic peritonitis or pleuritis [1,2]. Cats with FIP commonly have non-specific clinical signs such as anorexia, lethargy, a waxing/waning fever (often non-responsive to antibiotics), and lymphadenopathy [2]. It is crucial to distinguish FIP from other diseases like retroviral infection, lymphoma, and congestive heart failure, as these have similar presentations but require very different treatments [3,4,5].

# Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP): Unraveling a Lethal Viral Disease

Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a devastating viral disease that affects cats worldwide. Caused by a mutated form of the feline coronavirus, FIP can manifest in two deadly forms - effusive "wet" and non-effusive "dry" - leading to fluid accumulation, organ failure, and neurological complications. Despite its ubiquity, diagnosing FIP remains a significant challenge, requiring a combination of clinical signs, laboratory testing, and specialized diagnostics. However, the recent development of effective antiviral treatments has transformed the prognosis for affected cats, offering renewed hope in the fight against this previously untreatable disease.

## Conclusion

The complexity of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is underscored by its variable clinical presentation, non-specific laboratory findings, and the lack of a definitive diagnostic test. However, the introduction of targeted antiviral therapies has been a game-changer, drastically improving the outlook for cats with this once-fatal disease. While FIP vaccination remains limited in efficacy, preventive measures focused on reducing coronavirus exposure in high-risk environments can help mitigate the risk. As research continues to unravel the mysteries of FIP, veterinary professionals and cat owners alike remain vigilant in their efforts to safeguard the health and well-being of our feline companions.
