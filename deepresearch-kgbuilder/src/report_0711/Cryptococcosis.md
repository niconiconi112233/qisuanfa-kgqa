## Disease Overview

Cryptococcosis is a fungal infection caused by the Cryptococcus neoformans - Cryptococcus gattii complex. The disease occurs worldwide, but is most common in the western United States, Canada, and Australia [1]. Infection typically occurs through inhalation of the fungal spores, which can survive in soil and bird droppings for years [1,2]. 

Cats are at least 5 times more likely to develop cryptococcosis compared to dogs and horses [3]. The disease can affect animals of any age, with average ages of 6-8 years in cats and 2-3 years in dogs [4-9]. There are no consistent breed or sex predilections [4-10]. Cats with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) or feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are not predisposed to cryptococcosis, though their response to treatment may be slower [6,7,8]. 

The most common clinical signs include nasal/sinus disease, skin lesions, and central nervous system involvement [4,5,7]. Dogs tend to have more disseminated disease and central nervous system involvement compared to cats [4,5,7,8]. Diagnosis is typically made through serum cryptococcal antigen testing, which is highly sensitive and specific [21,22]. Molecular typing can differentiate between the C. neoformans and C. gattii species, which appear to have some host specificity [4].

## Common Pathogens

Cryptococcosis is primarily caused by two main species of fungi: *Cryptococcus neoformans* and *Cryptococcus gattii*. *Cryptococcus neoformans* is the most common species infecting cats and dogs, while *C. gattii* has emerged as an important pathogen, especially in certain geographic regions like the Pacific Northwest of North America [2].

*Cryptococcus neoformans* has a worldwide distribution and is commonly found in pigeon droppings and decaying plant matter. In contrast, *C. gattii* was originally thought to be a tropical or subtropical pathogen, but has recently emerged in temperate regions as well [2,4]. Genotyping has revealed distinct molecular types of *C. gattii* that differ in their geographic distribution and virulence [2].

While infection with either *C. neoformans* or *C. gattii* can lead to similar clinical presentations, there are some differences. Patients infected with *C. gattii* tend to be immunocompetent, whereas *C. neoformans* more commonly infects immunocompromised hosts. Additionally, *C. gattii* infections are often associated with mass lesions in the brain and lungs, whereas *C. neoformans* can cause more disseminated disease [2,4].

Rare cases of cryptococcosis have also been reported in dogs and cats due to other *Cryptococcus* species like *C. albidus* and *C. laurentii*, though these are much less common [2].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Cryptococcosis can manifest in cats in several ways, with the upper respiratory tract being the most common site of infection. Common symptoms include:

[1] Nasal discharge: Cats may have unilateral or bilateral chronic nasal discharge that can be blood-tinged, yellow, clear, or a combination of mucus and pus. 

[2] Nasal swelling and masses: A hard swelling over the bridge of the nose is common, and cats may develop polyp-like masses in the nasal passages that can cause difficulty breathing.

[3] Skin lesions: Cats often develop skin lesions such as nodules, papules, or ulcers that may drain fluid. These are commonly found on the head and neck.

[4] Neurological signs: If the infection spreads to the central nervous system, cats may exhibit depression, behavioral changes, seizures, muscle weakness, and blindness from optic nerve involvement.

[5] Less common signs: Coughing, rapid breathing, and involvement of abdominal organs are less common in cats compared to other species.

Overall, cats are more likely to have localized nasal and skin involvement, while dogs tend to have more disseminated disease with higher rates of central nervous system and multisystemic involvement. Careful evaluation of clinical signs, diagnostic testing, and imaging are necessary to diagnose and manage this fungal infection in cats.

## Diagnostic Methods

The most rapid and reliable method to diagnose cryptococcosis is antigen detection in body fluids such as serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), abdominal fluid, or urine. [1] A latex cryptococcal antigen agglutination test (LCAT) is commercially available and highly sensitive and specific for detecting cryptococcal antigen. [1,2] This test can be used to monitor response to treatment, as antigen titers decrease with successful therapy. [1,2]

Cytological evaluation of samples such as nasal exudate, skin exudate, CSF, or fluid from ocular or other body cavities can also aid diagnosis by identifying the characteristic encapsulated yeast forms of Cryptococcus. [1,2] Histopathology with fungal stains and immunohistochemistry may be useful if organisms are not detected on cytology. [1] 

Culture of Cryptococcus is possible from various samples, but takes at least a week for growth. [1,2] Molecular techniques like PCR are also available, though the diagnostic performance is still unknown. [2] Differentiation between the major species, C. neoformans and C. gattii, can be done using specialized agar media. [2]

Overall, the combination of compatible clinical signs, positive antigen detection, and identification of the characteristic yeast forms provides the most reliable diagnosis of cryptococcosis. [1,2]

## Treatment Options

Cryptococcosis in cats is typically treated with antifungal medications, often in combination, to combat the fungal infection. The primary treatment options include:

[1] Fluconazole: This oral antifungal medication is considered the first-line treatment for mild to moderate cryptococcosis in cats. The typical dose is 10 mg/kg every 12 hours, and treatment duration is usually 6-12 months. [1,2]

[2] Itraconazole: This oral antifungal can be used as an alternative to fluconazole, especially if the cat does not tolerate fluconazole well. Dosing for cats is 10 mg/kg daily for capsules or 4-7 mg/kg daily for the liquid formulation. Treatment duration is also 6-12 months. [1,2]

[3] Amphotericin B: For severe or disseminated cryptococcosis, amphotericin B is often added, typically administered intravenously 3 times per week or every other day. Amphotericin B can be given alone or in combination with fluconazole. The cumulative dose should not exceed 12 mg/kg in cats. [1,2] 

[4] Flucytosine: This oral antifungal can be used in combination with amphotericin B, especially for cats with central nervous system involvement, as it helps penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Cats generally tolerate flucytosine better than dogs. [1,2]

In addition to antifungal therapy, supportive care is important, such as managing seizures, pain, and intracranial hypertension. Monitoring antigen titers every 2-3 months can help guide the duration of treatment, which is typically at least 6 months and occasionally lifelong. [1,2]

## Preventive Measures

To prevent cryptococcosis, it is important to limit exposure to the fungus in the environment. Vaccination is not available, so prevention relies on environmental management strategies:

- Avoid areas with high concentrations of bird droppings, especially from pigeons, as these can harbor the fungus [1]. This includes restricting outdoor access, especially in endemic regions.

- Regularly clean and disinfect areas where cats spend time, such as litter boxes, to remove any fungal contamination [2]. 

- For cats with outdoor access, avoid activities that may increase risk of exposure, such as digging in soil or visiting botanical gardens [2].

- Ensure proper ventilation in indoor environments to reduce aerosolization of fungal spores [1].

Regular monitoring and testing for early signs of infection, as well as prompt treatment, can also help prevent the spread and severity of cryptococcosis in cats. Owners should work closely with their veterinarian to implement these preventive measures.

## Differential Diagnosis

When diagnosing cryptococcosis, it is important to consider other diseases with similar symptoms. Nasal cryptococcosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis in dogs and cats with nasal and nasopharyngeal masses [1]. Clinically, the diagnosis is often made through a combination of supportive clinical findings and the cryptococcal antigen latex agglutination test, which is highly sensitive and specific [2]. 

In contrast to cats, more than 50% of dogs may have disseminated disease with central nervous system or ocular involvement, and their clinical signs are often related to meningoencephalitis [4]. Feline cryptococcosis can often be diagnosed through an antigen detection test, known as a Latex Agglutination Test (LAT), on a cat's blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid [3]. Cryptococcosis is a type of fungal infection that occurs when a cat inhales spores from a type of fungus that grows in organic material such as soil, decaying wood, and bird droppings [5].
