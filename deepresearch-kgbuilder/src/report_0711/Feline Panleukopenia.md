## Disease Overview

Feline panleukopenia is a highly contagious, potentially fatal viral disease of cats caused by the feline panleukopenia virus (FPV). [1,2] FPV is a small, single-stranded non-enveloped DNA virus that is closely related to the canine parvovirus (CPV-2), but has been known since the 1920s while CPV-2 emerged in the late 1970s. [2,3]

FPV primarily affects domestic and wild cats, but has also been associated with disease in raccoons, mink, foxes, and even a monkey. [2,3] The virus is endemic worldwide in unvaccinated cat populations and can persist in the environment for over a year unless properly disinfected. [2,3] 

Feline panleukopenia is most common in kittens under 1 year of age, especially those around the time of weaning when maternal antibodies wane. However, the disease can occur in unvaccinated or improperly vaccinated cats of any age. [3,4] Outbreaks correlate with increases in susceptible newborn kittens and occur most often in multi-cat households and enclosed environments like shelters. [3,5] FPV can also infect cats with outdoor exposure like barn, feral, and stray cats. [3]

## Viral Cause

Feline parvovirus (FPV) is the virus that causes feline panleukopenia. FPV is closely related to canine parvovirus (CPV), and they are both members of the Carnivore protoparvovirus-1 species [1]. Both viruses cause an acute disease, with the virus replicating for less than seven days before being cleared by the developing immune responses [2,3]. 

FPV primarily infects cats and other felids, while CPV can infect both dogs and cats. The viruses have a broad tropism for rapidly dividing cells, and they can replicate in the lymphoid tissues, intestinal crypts, and developing fetuses [1,2]. This leads to the characteristic clinical signs of feline panleukopenia, including depression, vomiting, diarrhea, and leukopenia.

While FPV and CPV are closely related, they have some genetic differences. For example, a single amino acid change in the VP2 capsid protein can determine the host specificity of the virus [4]. This has allowed CPV to evolve and acquire the ability to infect cats, in addition to dogs. In fact, some studies have found that CPV may be a more common cause of disease in unvaccinated cats than FPV in certain regions [5,6].

Overall, the feline parvovirus that causes panleukopenia is closely related to the canine parvovirus, and they share many similarities in terms of their pathogenesis and ability to infect multiple host species. However, the specific genetic differences between the viruses can impact their host range and potential to cause disease.

## Clinical Symptoms

Feline panleukopenia is a highly contagious, often fatal parvoviral disease of cats worldwide. The clinical signs of feline panleukopenia include depression, anorexia, high fever, vomiting, and diarrhea leading to severe dehydration [1]. Kittens are most commonly and severely affected, and sudden death is common [1]. 

Cats with acute panleukopenia show high fever (40–41.7°C [104–107°F]), profound depression, complete anorexia, and severe dehydration leading to shock [1]. Vomiting, which usually develops 1–2 days after the onset of fever, is typically bilious and unrelated to eating [1]. Diarrhea is not always present and usually does not contain blood [1]. Hypothermia and hypoglycemia can also develop alongside septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation [1]. The duration of acute infection is seldom more than 5-7 days, and median survival time after hospital admission is around 3 days [1,7].

Peracute cases resulting in sudden death are common in young kittens, especially those in shelters or catteries [1]. Kittens infected before or shortly after birth may also suffer neurological damage, leading to cerebellar hypoplasia, incoordination, and tremors [1]. Overall, the prognosis for cats with acute panleukopenia is poor, with survival rates of only 20-51% reported for hospitalized cases [6,7].

## Diagnostic Methods

Feline panleukopenia is a highly contagious and potentially fatal viral disease that primarily affects young, unvaccinated cats. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential for proper treatment and control of disease outbreaks, especially in shelter settings.

The various diagnostic tests available for detecting and confirming feline panleukopenia include:

1. [1] Patient-side ELISA tests: These tests can detect the presence of feline parvovirus (FPV) antigen in samples such as vomitus, feces, or rectal swabs. They provide rapid results, with a sensitivity of 50-80% depending on viral shedding levels. Both strong and weak positive results should be considered indicative of infection.

2. [2] Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing: PCR assays performed at diagnostic laboratories can confirm the presence of FPV DNA in whole blood, feces, or tissue samples. Quantitative PCR can help distinguish between vaccine-induced and field virus shedding.

3. Hematology: A complete blood count or blood smear may reveal the characteristic severe neutropenia and lymphopenia associated with feline panleukopenia.

4. Necropsy and histopathology: In cases of sudden death or euthanasia, postmortem examination and tissue analysis can provide a definitive diagnosis. Histologic lesions include dilated intestinal crypts, necrosis of epithelial cells, and a lack of inflammatory cell infiltration.

While a presumptive diagnosis can be made based on compatible clinical signs and patient history, confirmatory testing is important. Negative ELISA results in kittens with typical signs should be followed up with additional testing, as the sensitivity of these rapid tests can be limited. Additionally, vaccination within 14 days may cause false positive results, so interpretation should consider the vaccination status.

Ultimately, the choice of diagnostic approach depends on the resources available, the clinical scenario, and the need for rapid results versus more definitive confirmation. A multimodal approach combining clinical signs, ELISA, and laboratory diagnostics provides the best opportunity for timely and accurate diagnosis of feline panleukopenia.

## Treatment Options

The prognosis for cats with acute panleukopenia is poor, with survival rates of 20-51% reported for cats hospitalized for supportive treatment [1,2]. Successful treatment is challenging, and when the disease is severe, euthanasia may be the most compassionate option.

For cats elected for treatment, supportive care is the foundation. This includes intensive fluid therapy to correct dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and hypoglycemia [2]. Antiemetic medications like maropitant and ondansetron can help control vomiting and allow for earlier enteral feeding [2]. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated to prevent secondary bacterial infections arising from the compromised immune system and gut barrier [2]. Anthelmintic therapy may also be required to address concurrent intestinal parasitism [2].

While some immune-targeted therapies have been explored, such as recombinant feline interferon omega and canine parvovirus monoclonal antibodies, the evidence for their efficacy in cats is limited [7,12]. Passive immunization using anti-FPV serum, either from recovered cats or commercial products, is practiced in some regions, but documented effectiveness is lacking [2].

Overall, the focus for managing feline panleukopenia remains on supportive nursing care, with a poor prognosis even with intensive treatment. Prevention through vaccination is critical, especially in high-risk environments like animal shelters [1,13].

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent feline panleukopenia. Kittens should receive their first dose of the feline panleukopenia vaccine (FVRCP) no earlier than 6 weeks of age, followed by additional doses every 3-4 weeks until 16-20 weeks of age.[1] Adult cats should receive a booster dose at 6 months, with annual or triennial boosters thereafter.[2] 

In addition to vaccination, other preventive measures include isolating sick cats, disinfecting potentially contaminated environments, and controlling fleas. Cats may become infected through contact with infected cats, their bodily fluids, or virus-contaminated objects like food bowls and litter boxes.[2] Maintaining good hygiene and limiting exposure can help protect unvaccinated cats.

## Differential Diagnosis

Feline panleukopenia can present with similar symptoms to other diseases, including salmonellosis, feline infectious peritonitis, and toxoplasmosis.[1] Factors that may help differentiate these include the severity of the clinical signs, presence of leukopenia, and history of potential exposures.

Salmonellosis can cause gastrointestinal signs and sepsis, similar to panleukopenia, but may not necessarily result in profound leukopenia.[1] Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) can also present with nonspecific systemic signs, but the disease course is typically more protracted compared to the rapid progression seen in panleukopenia.[1] Toxoplasmosis may cause neurological signs, fever, and anorexia, but the clinical presentation can vary widely.[1]

Overall, a combination of the patient's history, physical exam findings, and laboratory abnormalities (particularly the presence of leukopenia) are key to differentiating feline panleukopenia from other potential causes of similar clinical signs.[1,2]
