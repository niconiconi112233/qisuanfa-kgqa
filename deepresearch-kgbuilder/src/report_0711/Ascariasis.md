## Disease Overview

Ascariasis is a parasitic disease caused by the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides. Ascaris is a nematode worm that infects the human intestine and can cause significant health issues, particularly in children [1]. Ascaris infections are transmitted through the ingestion of infective eggs from contaminated soil, food, or water [2]. 

The disease is widespread globally, with an estimated 730 million people infected worldwide [3]. Ascariasis is especially prevalent in low- and middle-income countries with poor sanitation infrastructure and hygiene practices [3]. Children aged 5-15 years are most commonly affected, both in terms of prevalence and intensity of infection [3].

Symptoms of ascariasis can range from asymptomatic infections to severe cases involving intestinal obstruction, malnutrition, and impaired growth and cognitive development in children [4,5]. The infective dose for Ascaris eggs is very low, and multiple infections are often required to build up a high worm burden [6]. Reinfection after treatment is common in areas with widespread environmental contamination [6].

## Common Pathogens

Roundworms are the most common gastrointestinal parasites affecting dogs and cats. The key roundworm species are:

- _Toxocara canis_: The most important roundworm affecting dogs, as it can cause serious disease in puppies and is also zoonotic. Dogs become infected through transplacental transmission, ingestion of larvated eggs, and ingestion of paratenic hosts.

- _Toxocara cati_: The most common roundworm affecting cats. Cats become infected through ingestion of larvated eggs and paratenic hosts, but not through transplacental transmission. It is also zoonotic.

- _Toxascaris leonina_: A less common roundworm that can infect both dogs and cats. Infection occurs through ingestion of larvated eggs and paratenic hosts, without any somatic migration. It is not zoonotic.

Additionally, _Baylisascaris procyonis_, the raccoon roundworm, can occasionally infect dogs and is a serious zoonotic parasite that can cause neural larval migrans in humans. [1][2]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Roundworm infection in pets can present with a variety of clinical signs, particularly in puppies and kittens. The most common symptoms include:

- Failure to thrive or "pot-bellied" appearance [1,2]
- Poor coat quality [1,2]  
- Diarrhea, sometimes with mucus [1,2]
- Vomiting, including vomiting of worms [1,2]
- Coughing (from migrating larvae) [1]

Severe infections in young animals can also lead to more serious complications such as intestinal blockage, pneumonia, liver damage, and even death in some cases [1,2]. 

Adult pets with roundworm infections may show few or no clinical signs, as the larvae often become encysted in tissues rather than developing into adult worms in the intestines [3]. However, reactivation of these larvae can occur, leading to recurrent infections.

Overall, roundworm disease is most common and problematic in puppies and kittens, while adult animals typically experience subclinical or mild infections [1-3].

## Diagnostic Methods

Roundworm infections in dogs and cats are typically diagnosed through a combination of history, clinical signs, and laboratory testing. The primary diagnostic methods include:

[1] Fecal flotation: Examination of a fecal sample under a microscope to identify the characteristic roundworm eggs. This is considered the gold standard for diagnosis, as it can differentiate between the different species of roundworms. [2]

[2] Fecal antigen testing: Commercial tests are available that can detect roundworm antigens in the feces, which can be useful in cases where few eggs are present or single-sex infections. However, this method cannot differentiate between species. [1]

[3] Identification of adult worms: Occasionally, pet owners may see adult roundworms in the vomit or feces of infected animals, which can aid in diagnosis. The morphological characteristics of the adult worms can help identify the specific species. [1,2]

To maximize the sensitivity of diagnosis, veterinarians often recommend multiple fecal examinations, as roundworm egg shedding can be intermittent. Additionally, differentiating between the eggs of Toxocara species (which have zoonotic potential) and Toxascaris species is important for appropriate treatment and prevention strategies. [1,2]

## Treatment Options

Roundworms are common parasites in dogs and cats, particularly in young animals. Multiple anthelmintic medications are approved for the treatment and prevention of roundworm infections. 

In dogs, compounds such as fenbendazole, milbemycin, moxidectin, piperazine, and pyrantel are used to treat roundworm infections [1]. For drugs that only kill adult parasites, two treatments 10-14 days apart are typically required to eliminate the infection. Preventive programs using heartworm medications that contain milbemycin, moxidectin, or ivermectin/pyrantel also control intestinal ascarid infections [1].

In cats, approved medications for treating roundworms include emodepside, eprinomectin, fenbendazole, milbemycin, moxidectin, piperazine, pyrantel, and selamectin [2]. As with dogs, drugs that target only adult worms may require repeat dosing to clear the infection. Preventive programs using eprinomectin/praziquantel, milbemycin/praziquantel, or selamectin/sarolaner also control ascarid infections in cats [2].

Regular fecal monitoring and prompt disposal of feces are important for controlling environmental contamination and preventing reinfection. Strict hygiene is also crucial, particularly for children, to minimize the risk of accidental human ingestion of roundworm eggs.

## Preventive Measures

Regular deworming is essential to prevent the spread of ascariasis. Puppies should be dewormed starting at 2 weeks of age and every 2 weeks until broader parasite control begins. Adult dogs should receive year-round broad-spectrum parasite control products that are effective against ascarids [1].

Owners should also take measures to minimize environmental contamination. Feces should be immediately picked up when walking dogs, and regularly removed from yards [1]. Sandboxes, gardens, and other areas should be protected from fecal contamination [1]. Avoiding areas frequented by raccoons, which can harbor the raccoon roundworm Baylisascaris procyonis, is also recommended [1].

In addition, keeping dogs leashed or confined to a fenced yard can limit their exposure to sources of infection, such as infected feces or small animals that may carry infective larvae [1]. Early and regular deworming, along with environmental management, are key to preventing ascariasis in dogs.

## Differential Diagnosis

Intestinal parasites can have similar symptoms, so a differential diagnosis is important to determine the specific type of infection. While roundworms, hookworms, and whipworms all commonly infect dogs, there are some key differences to consider:

Roundworms [1] can cause stunted growth, digestive upset, and a characteristic "pot-bellied" appearance in puppies, as the worms live freely in the intestines. Hookworms [2] attach to the intestinal lining and feed on blood, leading to anemia, especially in young animals. Whipworms [3] live in the large intestine and cause chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and sometimes bloody stools.

Tapeworms [4] typically cause few problems in adult dogs, but can stunt growth in puppies. The type of tapeworm is also important, as some like Echinococcus are zoonotic and can infect humans.

Other intestinal parasites like coccidia [5] and Giardia [5] are single-celled organisms that can cause diarrhea, poor appetite, and dehydration, especially in young animals. These are diagnosed differently than worms.

Careful examination of a fecal sample is crucial to identify the specific parasite and guide appropriate treatment. Considering the clinical signs, life cycle, and diagnostic methods for each type of parasite is important for an accurate differential diagnosis.

# Pet Disease: Ascariasis

Ascariasis is a widespread parasitic disease caused by the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides. This intestinal infection disproportionately impacts children in low- and middle-income countries with poor sanitation. While symptoms can range from asymptomatic to severe, ascariasis is often characterized by digestive issues, malnutrition, and impaired growth in young pets. Effective diagnosis relies on fecal examinations, and treatment with deworming medications is typically successful. However, reinfection is common without proper environmental management and hygiene practices. This report explores the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of ascariasis in companion animals.

## Summary

Roundworm infections are a common issue in dogs and cats, particularly affecting young animals. Prompt diagnosis through fecal examination and treatment with approved anthelmintic medications can effectively clear ascariasis. However, strict preventive measures are crucial to limit environmental contamination and repeated exposures. Regular deworming, proper fecal disposal, and controlling access to areas with potential raccoon latrines are key to minimizing the burden of this parasitic disease. By addressing both clinical management and environmental factors, veterinary teams can help pet owners keep their animals healthy and reduce the risk of zoonotic transmission.
