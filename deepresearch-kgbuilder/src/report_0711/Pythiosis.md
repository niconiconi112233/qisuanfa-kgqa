## Disease Overview

Pythiosis is a disease caused by the fungal-like organism Pythium insidiosum. It is most commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, with a seasonal peak in the United States between August and December. 

The disease can manifest in different forms in dogs, including cutaneous (skin) and gastrointestinal. Skin lesions are typically non-healing, ulcerated, and have draining tracts, most often affecting the limbs, ventral trunk, or perineum. Gastrointestinal pythiosis causes signs like vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and an abdominal mass. The disease can also spread to other organs like the lungs and urinary tract [1,4].

Diagnosis can be challenging, as the organism is difficult to culture and identify microscopically. The MiraVista Pythium IgG enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is a highly sensitive and specific blood test that can aid in diagnosis [1]. 

Treatment options are limited, with surgical removal of lesions and long-term antifungal therapy being the main approaches. Even with treatment, the prognosis for pythiosis is generally poor, especially for dogs with extensive or systemic disease [4,5].

## Common Pathogens

Pythiosis is a serious infection caused by the fungal-like organism *Pythium insidiosum* [1]. This pathogen is found in warm, swampy environments and can infect dogs, cats, and other mammals through direct contact with contaminated water or ingestion of infected plants [1]. 

In dogs and cats, pythiosis most commonly affects the skin, causing ulcerative lesions, or the gastrointestinal tract, leading to vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss [1]. Respiratory and urogenital infections are less common but can also occur [1]. The infection is often slowly progressive and locally invasive, though dissemination to other organs is uncommon [1].

Diagnosis can be challenging, as the organism is difficult to visualize on cytology or histopathology [1]. However, serological testing using an anti-*Pythium* IgG enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is a highly sensitive and specific method [1]. Treatment typically involves a combination of surgical debulking, antifungal medications, and potentially immunotherapy, though the prognosis remains guarded [1,2].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Pythiosis is a serious and potentially fatal infectious disease in companion animals caused by the water mold Pythium insidiosum. The clinical presentation varies depending on the location of the infection, but common symptoms include:

Gastrointestinal Pythiosis:
- Vomiting, diarrhea, hematochezia (bloody stool), tenesmus (straining to defecate)
- Decreased appetite, weight loss, poor body condition
- Presence of an abdominal mass

Cutaneous/Subcutaneous Pythiosis: 
- Non-healing, ulcerative, and nodular skin lesions with draining tracts, often affecting the limbs, ventral trunk, or perineum
- Subcutaneous masses, especially around the eyes, inguinal area, or tail base in cats

Other Body Systems:
- Respiratory signs like tachypnea (rapid breathing), dyspnea (difficulty breathing), or cough due to tracheobronchial lymphadenopathy
- Urinary signs like stranguria (painful urination), pollakiuria (frequent urination), and hematuria (blood in urine) with urogenital involvement

Diagnosis can be challenging as the organism may be scarce or absent on cytology or histopathology. Imaging studies like abdominal ultrasound or CT may show characteristic lesions. Serological testing with the MiraVista Pythium IgG enzyme immunoassay is a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tool [1,2].

## Diagnostic Methods

Early diagnosis is essential for effective treatment and survival of pythiosis in dogs and cats. Diagnosis can be challenging as the organism is often difficult to detect through routine testing.

The primary diagnostic approach includes a combination of clinical presentation, laboratory testing, and imaging. Clinical signs may include non-healing wounds, ulcerated nodules, draining tracts, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal masses [1]. Laboratory changes are often non-specific, such as anemia, eosinophilia, and hyperglobulinemia [3].

Cytology and histopathology can sometimes identify the characteristic Pythium hyphae, but they are often absent or difficult to distinguish from other fungi [1,3]. Advanced diagnostic tests like the MiraVista Pythium IgG enzyme immunoassay (EIA) have proven highly sensitive (>99%) and specific (>99%) for detecting pythiosis in dogs and cats [1]. This blood test can also be used to monitor treatment progress, as antibody levels decline with successful management.

Imaging techniques like abdominal ultrasound or CT scan can visualize lesions in the gastrointestinal tract or other affected organs [1,3]. Mesenteric lymph node involvement and loss of normal gut wall layering are common findings.

In summary, a multimodal diagnostic approach incorporating clinical signs, laboratory data, serology, and imaging is essential for prompt and accurate diagnosis of pythiosis. The MiraVista Pythium IgG EIA is a valuable tool that can aid in both diagnosis and treatment monitoring.

## Treatment Options

Successful management of pythiosis often requires a combination of medical and surgical approaches. For cutaneous pythiosis, surgical excision with wide margins is the preferred treatment. [1] After surgery, long-term antifungal therapy with itraconazole and terbinafine is recommended for at least 6 months to prevent recurrence. [2]

For gastrointestinal pythiosis, complete surgical removal of affected tissue is ideal, but this is often not possible due to the extent of disease at diagnosis. In these cases, medical treatment with itraconazole, terbinafine, and prednisone can be attempted, with around 75% of dogs going into remission. [2] Treatment duration is generally over 1 year.

Vaccination and the agricultural fungicide mefenoxam have also been used, but their benefits over standard therapy are unclear. [2] Monitoring with the *Pythium* IgG blood test can help assess response to treatment. [2] Overall, the prognosis for pythiosis remains guarded, with the best outcomes for small, early lesions that can be completely removed.

## Preventive Measures

The main preventive measures for pythiosis in pets are vaccination and environmental/isolation strategies:

[1] Vaccination can help reduce the size of pythiosis lesions. As soon as a dog is diagnosed with pythiosis, it should be vaccinated with the pythiosis vaccine to help limit the progression of the disease.[2]

Environmental and isolation strategies are also important. Pythiosis is caused by a water-borne organism, so limiting a pet's exposure to stagnant water sources like ponds, wetlands, and swamps can help prevent infection.[1,2] Keeping pets away from these high-risk environments, especially in the fall and winter when the organism thrives, is recommended.

Overall, a combination of prompt medical treatment, vaccination, and environmental management are the key preventive measures for pythiosis in dogs and cats. Early detection and intervention are critical for improving prognosis and quality of life for affected pets.

## Differential Diagnosis

Pythiosis can be difficult to diagnose, as the symptoms can be similar to other diseases. It is important to rule out the following conditions that have similar clinical presentations:

[1] Histoplasmosis: Infections with the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum can cause granulomatous lesions in the gastrointestinal tract or skin that resemble pythiosis. Histopathology and serology tests are needed to differentiate the two. [1,2]

[2] Lagenidiosis: This is another disease caused by the oomycete Lagenidium. It can present with similar cutaneous and gastrointestinal symptoms as pythiosis, but requires specialized testing to distinguish the causative organisms. [1]

[3] Conidiobolomycosis and Basidiobolomycosis: These are rare fungal infections that can produce granulomatous lesions, sometimes mistaken for pythiosis. Microscopic identification of the fungal hyphae is required. [1,2]  

[4] Gastrointestinal cancers: Infiltrative masses in the gastrointestinal tract can resemble the lesions seen in pythiosis. Biopsy and histopathology are needed to rule out neoplasia. [2,3]

Overall, a combination of clinical history, imaging, cytology/histopathology, and serological testing with the MiraVista Pythium IgG assay is required to arrive at a definitive diagnosis of pythiosis. [4]
