## Disease Overview

Hookworms are common internal parasites in dogs and cats, particularly puppies and kittens. The main hookworm species that infect dogs are *Ancylostoma caninum*, *Ancylostoma braziliense*, and *Uncinaria stenocephala*.[1] These hookworms attach to the lining of the small intestine and feed on the host's blood, causing damage and potential anemia.

Dogs become infected with hookworms through several routes: ingesting infective larvae from a contaminated environment, larval skin penetration, and ingesting larvae in the tissues of other animals like rodents.[1] Puppies can also become infected via the mother's milk during nursing.[1] 

While some infected pets show no symptoms, severe hookworm infections can lead to a variety of clinical signs including dark, tarry diarrhea, weight loss, pale gums, weakness, and anemia due to blood loss.[3] Respiratory issues may also occur when larvae migrate through the lungs.[4] Dermatitis with red, itchy skin lesions is another possible symptom, typically seen on the feet.[1]

Hookworm infections are diagnosed through fecal examination to detect the characteristic eggs. Treatment involves deworming medications, and prevention focuses on regular deworming, prompt removal of feces, and controlling environmental contamination.[1] Hookworms also pose a zoonotic risk, as the larvae can burrow into human skin and cause cutaneous larva migrans.[4]

## Common Pathogens

There are three main species of hookworm that can infect companion animals: *Ancylostoma caninum*, *Ancylostoma braziliense*, and *Uncinaria stenocephala* [1]. In the UK, *Uncinaria stenocephala*, also known as the northern hookworm, is the most common species found in dogs [3].

The life cycle of hookworms begins when adult worms living in the small intestine of infected animals pass eggs in their feces. These eggs hatch into larvae that develop into the infective third-stage larvae in the environment [1]. Dogs and cats can become infected by ingesting these infective larvae or through larval penetration of the skin [1,4]. 

Some species, like *A. caninum*, can also transmit larvae transplacentally or through the mother's milk to puppies [1,4]. After penetrating the skin, the larvae migrate through the body, entering the lungs before being coughed up and swallowed to reach the intestines [1,4].

Once in the intestines, the larvae mature into adult worms that attach to the intestinal wall and feed on the host's blood, leading to blood loss and potential anemia [1,4]. Hookworms can cause a variety of clinical signs, from skin irritation and gastrointestinal issues to severe anemia, depending on the level of infection [1,4].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Dogs and cats with hookworm infections can exhibit a range of clinical signs, with the severity depending on the hookworm species and the intensity of the infection. The most common clinical manifestations are related to intestinal distress and anemia [1].

Acute infections with the hookworm species *Ancylostoma caninum* often cause a severe, normocytic, normochromic anemia in young puppies. This can lead to weakness, lethargy, and even death in heavy infections [1,2]. Surviving puppies may develop some immunity but can still suffer from chronic, debilitating anemia, especially if they are debilitated or malnourished [1]. 

Mature dogs infected with *A. caninum* may not show obvious clinical signs if they only harbor a few worms, but they can still serve as a source of infection for puppies [1]. Diarrhea with dark, tarry feces can accompany severe *A. caninum* infections [1].

The hookworm species *Ancylostoma braziliense*, *Ancylostoma tubaeforme*, *Ancylostoma ceylanicum*, and *Uncinaria stenocephala* are not as avid blood feeders as *A. caninum*, so anemia is less common. However, these species can still cause hypoproteinemia due to seepage of serum around their attachment sites in the intestine [1].

Dermatitis due to larval skin penetration can occur with any hookworm species, but is most frequently seen with *U. stenocephala* infections, where the lesions are typically found in the interdigital spaces [1,3]. Skin infections with *U. stenocephala* rarely mature into adult worms in the intestine [3].

## Diagnostic Methods

Hookworm infections can be diagnosed through a combination of clinical assessment and laboratory testing:

[1] Clinical evaluation: The characteristic signs of hookworm dermatitis include pruritic, erythematous lesions, especially on the ventral chest, interdigital spaces, and footpads. A history of poor husbandry and lack of regular deworming may also be suggestive. [1]

[2] Fecal examination: Centrifugal fecal flotation is the standard diagnostic test to detect hookworm eggs in the feces. The thin-shelled, oval eggs of _Ancylostoma_ spp. (52-79 x 28-58 μm) and _Uncinaria_ spp. (71-92 x 35-58 μm) can be easily identified under a microscope. [1,3]

[3] Skin biopsy: While larvae are rarely found in skin biopsies, histopathology can reveal a perivascular dermatitis with eosinophils and neutrophils, as well as occasional subcorneal pustules containing the migrating larvae. [1]

[4] Fecal antigen testing: Commercial tests that detect hookworm antigens in the feces can be useful in identifying infections with few adult worms or young larvae that may not be shedding eggs. [3]

[5] Postmortem examination: At necropsy, the small intestine should be carefully examined for the presence and burden of adult hookworms. Morphological criteria can then be used to identify the parasite species. [1]

Overall, a combination of clinical signs, fecal examination, and sometimes additional diagnostics like skin biopsy or antigen testing can be used to confirm a diagnosis of hookworm infection and identify the causative species.

## Treatment Options

Hookworm dermatitis caused by the northern hookworm (_Uncinaria stenocephala_) can be effectively treated through a combination of medical and environmental approaches.

Dogs with hookworm dermatitis should be treated with a product that has a license for treating _Uncinaria_. Medications such as moxidectin, fenbendazole, nitroscanate, pyrantel, or off-label ivermectin (0.044 mg/kg dose) can provide effective treatment and ongoing protection against reinfection [1,2]. Selamectin and milbemycin oxime are not labeled for treating hookworm infections in dogs [2].

In addition to medical treatment, environmental control measures are essential. Thorough disinfection of kennels and bedding with a 1% bleach solution, along with prompt removal of feces from the environment, can help eliminate hookworm eggs and larvae [1]. For dirt runs or grassy areas, treatment with sodium borate (0.5 kg per square meter) can also help decontaminate the environment [1].

Supportive care, such as managing secondary skin infections, may also be necessary. Pruritus can be addressed with appropriate anti-pruritic medications or shampoos.

With proper treatment and environmental control, the prognosis for animals with hookworm dermatitis is generally good. Ongoing monitoring and preventative deworming are recommended to ensure complete resolution of the infection and prevent reoccurrence [1,2].

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination and environmental management are key strategies for preventing hookworm infections in dogs.

Vaccination against hookworms is recommended, especially for young puppies and high-risk dogs. Vaccines can help reduce the severity of infection and blood loss associated with hookworms [1]. Regular deworming with effective anthelmintic medications is also important, as it helps eliminate existing infections and prevent environmental contamination.

In addition to vaccination, strict environmental management is crucial for preventing hookworm transmission. This includes:

- Promptly removing dog feces from the environment, as hookworm eggs and larvae can contaminate soil and spread infection [2,3]. 
- Avoiding overcrowding and unsanitary conditions, which facilitate the spread of hookworms [2].
- Treating pregnant and nursing dogs with deworming medications to prevent transmitting hookworms to puppies [2,3].
- Maintaining good hygiene, such as washing hands after handling dogs and avoiding skin contact with contaminated soil [2].

Regular fecal testing and deworming, combined with an effective vaccine and proper environmental management, can significantly reduce the risk of hookworm infections in dogs. This integrated approach is key to preventing the spread of this parasite.

## Differential Diagnosis

A positive fecal exam for hookworm eggs provides supporting evidence but does not confirm a diagnosis. Differential diagnoses in dogs include atopic dermatitis, demodicosis, contact dermatitis, and pelodera dermatitis [1]. Other conditions that can cause similar skin lesions and pruritus include irritant contact dermatitis, necrolytic migratory erythema, and pemphigus foliaceus [2].

The history and clinical presentation are important in making the diagnosis, as most cases of hookworm dermatitis are associated with poor husbandry and housing dogs on contaminated soil or grass [2]. Cytological examination of skin samples and fecal flotation can help identify the parasite, but larvae are rarely found on biopsy [1,2]. Monitoring the response to treatment can also aid in reaching an accurate diagnosis.
