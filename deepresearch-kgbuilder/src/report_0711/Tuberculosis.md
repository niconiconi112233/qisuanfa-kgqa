## Disease Overview

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that can affect various animal species, including pets such as dogs and cats. The primary causative agents are Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) bacteria, specifically M. bovis and M. caprae [1]. These bacteria can be transmitted between animals and, in some cases, to humans as well [2]. 

Susceptibility to TB varies across different species, with primates, guinea pigs, and humans being relatively more susceptible, while cattle, rabbits, and cats are also known to be susceptible to M. bovis [3]. Demographic factors such as sex and age can also influence the risk of MTBC infection, with males and adults generally at higher risk than females and younger individuals [4].

Bovine tuberculosis, a form of the disease affecting cattle, is a rare but serious condition that can also impact other mammals, including pets [5]. Overall, understanding the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of tuberculosis in multi-host wildlife systems is crucial for effective disease management and prevention strategies.

## Common Pathogens

Tuberculosis (TB) in companion animals is primarily caused by four types of Mycobacterium bacteria: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium avium, and Mycobacterium malmoense [1]. Of these, M. tuberculosis and M. bovis are the most pathogenic and can infect a wide range of animal species, including dogs, cats, and other mammals [2,3].

M. tuberculosis is highly host-specific and typically infects humans, but can also cause progressive disease in certain animal species, such as non-human primates, dogs, pigs, cattle, and elephants [4]. M. bovis, on the other hand, has a broader host range and can lead to progressive disease in many mammalian species, including humans [4].

Companion animals, particularly dogs and cats, can contract TB through exposure to infected humans or other animals, or by consuming contaminated food or water [1,5]. While subclinical infections are common, some animals may develop clinical signs such as respiratory, gastrointestinal, or hepatic manifestations [2].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

In dogs, the common clinical signs of tuberculosis (TB) include a chronic cough, difficulty breathing, weight loss, fever, and weakness [1,2,3,4]. The infection can primarily affect the lungs, abdomen, or become disseminated throughout the body, leading to a variety of non-specific symptoms [2]. 

In cats, the most frequently observed signs are lethargy, loss of appetite, weight loss, and fever [6,7]. Coughing, difficulty breathing, and gastrointestinal issues may also occur, depending on the organs affected [6,7]. Skin lesions, abscesses, or non-healing wounds can be a sign of TB in both dogs and cats [5,8].

Overall, the clinical presentation of TB in pets is often non-specific, making it challenging to diagnose without appropriate diagnostic testing [3,9]. Veterinary professionals should maintain a high index of suspicion, especially in animals with relevant risk factors or exposure history.

## Diagnostic Methods

Tuberculosis in pets can present with a range of clinical signs, including fever, weight loss, anorexia, and a harsh, non-productive cough. [1] In cases where the infection occurred through a bite wound, skin granulomas may be the initial sign. [1] In cats, disseminated disease can cause more varied symptoms like hepatosplenomegaly, pleural and pericardial effusions, and generalized lymphadenopathy. [3]

To diagnose tuberculosis, veterinarians will typically perform laboratory testing. This can include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Mycobacterium bovis DNA. [2,4] Culture tests on samples such as respiratory secretions or lymph node aspirates can also be used to isolate the causative bacteria. [4,5] Radiographic imaging of the lungs may reveal abnormalities as well. [5]

## Treatment Options

The treatment of tuberculosis in companion animals, such as dogs, can be challenging. In most cases, a triple-antimicrobial therapy approach is recommended, comprising rifampicin, a macrolide/azalide (azithromycin or clarithromycin), and a third antimicrobial agent [1,2]. This optimized protocol offers an excellent chance of a successful outcome in dogs where treatment can be considered and is deemed appropriate [2]. 

However, treatment options are often limited due to public health concerns. In many cases, euthanasia may be recommended for confirmed or suspected cases of advanced tuberculous lesions, as the disease can be transmissible to humans [3,4]. Therefore, the decision to treat a dog with tuberculosis should be made in consultation with a veterinarian, considering the potential risks and benefits [4,5].

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is a key strategy for preventing tuberculosis (TB) in pets. The Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is the only approved vaccine for TB prevention, though its protective efficacy needs further improvement [1,2]. Studies have shown that BCG vaccination can reduce TB transmission from infected animals [4]. However, the CDC recommends BCG vaccination only for children who are continually exposed to TB and cannot be separated from the infectious source [5].

In addition to vaccination, environmental management is crucial for preventing TB in pets. This includes regular cleaning and disinfection of living spaces, as well as minimizing contact between pets and wildlife that may harbor the disease. Proper ventilation and air filtration can also help reduce the spread of TB in pet environments [3].

Overall, a comprehensive approach involving both vaccination and environmental control measures is necessary to effectively prevent TB in pets.

## Differential Diagnosis

When considering tuberculosis (TB) in pets, it is important to differentiate it from other diseases with similar respiratory symptoms. [1] Mycobacterium bovis, the bacteria that causes TB in cattle, can also infect domestic cats and potentially other companion animals. Therefore, TB should be considered as a differential diagnosis when pets present with respiratory signs. [1] 

Additionally, diagnosis of TB in animals relies on detecting the cellular immune response and identifying the specific mycobacterial organism through culture or molecular testing. [2] Other respiratory diseases that should be included in the differential diagnosis include canine TB, which has an emerging clinical presentation in dogs. [3] Bovine TB in cattle can also cause respiratory signs, though this is considered rare. [4]

It is crucial to accurately diagnose the cause of respiratory illness in pets, as TB can be transmitted between animals and from animals to humans. [5] Considering the appropriate differential diagnoses and utilizing the proper diagnostic tests is key to providing effective treatment and preventing the spread of this serious disease.
