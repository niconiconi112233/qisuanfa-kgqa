## Disease Overview

Canine parvoviral enteritis is a highly contagious viral disease that commonly affects young, unvaccinated dogs. The etiological agent is canine parvovirus (CPV), a non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that is believed to have arisen from feline panleukopenia virus. 

The virus replicates in rapidly dividing cells, particularly the intestinal crypt epithelium, lymphoid tissue, and bone marrow. This leads to villous atrophy, malabsorption, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and destruction of the immune system. Clinical signs include fever, lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. Leukopenia, hypoproteinemia, and hypoglycemia are common laboratory findings.

The disease is highly contagious and spreads through contact with virus-containing feces or fomites. Young, unvaccinated dogs are most susceptible, with certain breeds like Rottweilers and Dobermans at increased risk. Stress, concurrent infections, and poor nutrition can exacerbate the disease. With appropriate supportive care, survival rates can exceed 80%, but without treatment the mortality rate is very high.

## Common Pathogens

Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) is the most significant pathogen that causes viral enteritis in dogs [1,2]. There are three main variants of CPV-2 - CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and the more recently emerged CPV-2c [3,4]. All three variants can cause similar clinical disease in dogs [8,17]. 

Other viral pathogens that have been associated with enteritis and diarrhea in dogs include:

- Canine distemper virus (CDV) [15]
- Canine enteric coronavirus [13,14,18] 
- Rotaviruses
- Astroviruses
- Adenoviruses 
- Caliciviruses
- Emerging viruses like norovirus, kobuvirus, sapovirus, and possibly circovirus [13-17]

Canine enteric coronavirus primarily causes mild diarrhea in puppies less than 6 weeks old, and is often found in co-infections with other viral causes of gastroenteritis, including CPV-2 variants [18]. However, CPV-2 remains the most significant and pathogenic viral cause of enteritis in dogs [1,2].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Dogs infected with canine parvovirus often exhibit a range of common clinical symptoms and signs. Initial nonspecific signs may include lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These symptoms then typically progress to vomiting and hemorrhagic small-bowel diarrhea within 24-48 hours [1]. Around 25% of dogs may have nonhemorrhagic diarrhea instead [1].

Physical examination can reveal depression, fever, dehydration, and dilated, fluid-filled intestinal loops [1]. Abdominal pain may indicate a potential complication of intussusception. Severely affected dogs may present collapsed with prolonged capillary refill time, poor pulse quality, tachycardia, and hypothermia - signs consistent with septic shock [1]. Central nervous system signs are more commonly attributable to hypoglycemia, sepsis, or acid-base/electrolyte abnormalities rather than direct viral effects [1]. Inapparent or subclinical infection is also common [1].

## Diagnostic Methods

Canine parvovirus infection is typically diagnosed through a combination of clinical presentation, laboratory testing, and other techniques.

Clinical signs associated with canine parvoviral enteritis include anorexia, lethargy, vomiting, and diarrhea, which is often hemorrhagic [1]. During the course of illness, most dogs develop a moderate to severe leukopenia characterized by lymphopenia and neutropenia [1]. Prerenal azotemia, hypoalbuminemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and increased liver enzyme activities may also be noted on the serum biochemical profile [1].

The most common and convenient diagnostic method is the fecal parvoviral antigen ELISA test, which can provide rapid results, often within 15 minutes [1,2]. These tests generally have good to excellent sensitivity and specificity, even for the recently evolved CPV-2c strain [1]. However, false negative results can occur early in the course of infection or after the rapid decline in viral shedding that occurs within 10-12 days [1,2]. False positives have also been reported in some cases, such as within 4-10 days following vaccination with modified live CPV vaccine [1].

Alternative diagnostic methods include PCR testing to detect viral DNA in fecal samples, electron microscopy, and virus isolation [1,2]. Serological testing to demonstrate a 4-fold increase in CPV IgG antibody titer or the presence of CPV IgM antibodies can also confirm recent infection, but this testing is rarely used clinically [1].

In summary, a combination of compatible clinical signs, hematological changes, and positive fecal antigen ELISA testing are typically used to diagnose canine parvoviral enteritis. Additional testing such as PCR may be warranted in cases with a negative ELISA but a high index of suspicion [1,2].

## Treatment Options

The main goals of treatment for canine parvovirus enteritis include restoration of fluid, electrolyte, and metabolic abnormalities and prevention of secondary bacterial infection. [1]

Fluid therapy is the cornerstone of treatment. Intravenous fluids are used to rehydrate the patient, replace ongoing fluid losses from vomiting and diarrhea, and provide maintenance fluids. Electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia and hypoglycemia are also corrected through the fluids. [1]

Antibiotics are indicated to prevent bacterial translocation and sepsis due to the damaged intestinal barrier. Broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria are typically used. Common choices include ampicillin, cefazolin, enrofloxacin, and gentamicin. [1]

Anti-emetic medications such as maropitant, metoclopramide, and ondansetron are given to control vomiting, which helps maintain hydration and electrolyte balance. [1] 

Nutritional support is crucial, with small amounts of an easily digestible diet provided early on to nourish the intestinal cells. Feeding tubes may be needed for anorectic patients. [1]

Other potential treatments that may be used include plasma transfusions for hypoproteinemia, fecal transplants to restore gut microbiome, and the monoclonal antibody therapy CPMA to neutralize the virus. However, the benefits of these more advanced interventions are still being evaluated. [1,2]

With appropriate supportive care, survival rates for canine parvovirus enteritis can reach 70-90%. [1]

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is the most effective way to protect dogs against canine parvovirus. Puppies should receive a series of vaccinations starting at 6-8 weeks of age, with boosters every 3-4 weeks until they are at least 16 weeks old. [1] After the initial puppy series, dogs should receive a booster vaccine one year later, and then boosters every 3 years. [1] Vaccination with a modified live virus (MLV) vaccine is preferred, as it can induce immunity faster than killed vaccines. [1,2] 

In addition to vaccination, good hygiene and environmental management are crucial to prevent parvovirus transmission. The virus is highly resistant and can survive in the environment for long periods. [3] Proper disinfection of contaminated areas with dilute bleach (1:30 ratio with water) or other effective disinfectants is necessary. [4,5] Dogs with parvovirus should be isolated during illness and for up to 2 weeks after recovery to avoid spreading the virus. [3] Limiting exposure of unvaccinated puppies to high-risk areas like dog parks, pet stores, and boarding kennels can also reduce their risk of infection. [3]

## Differential Diagnosis

Canine parvoviral enteritis shares clinical signs with several other gastrointestinal diseases in dogs, so a differential diagnosis is important. Other conditions to consider include:

[1] Canine distemper virus infection - This viral infection can also cause gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea, as well as neurological signs. Distemper is differentiated from parvovirus by the presence of other characteristic signs like ocular and nasal discharge.[2]

[2] Other canine viral enteritides - Infections with canine enteric coronavirus, rotaviruses, astroviruses, and novel viruses like norovirus and kobuvirus can also lead to diarrhea and vomiting.[3,4] These are generally less severe than parvoviral enteritis.

[3] Dietary indiscretion - Eating something inappropriate can cause acute gastrointestinal upset and diarrhea in dogs.

[4] Gastrointestinal foreign body - An obstruction or perforation in the GI tract from a foreign object can present with vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.

[5] Enteric parasitic infections - Giardiasis, hookworms, roundworms, and other intestinal parasites can cause diarrhea and maldigestion.

[6] Enteric bacterial infections - Salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, and other bacterial gastroenteritides can mimic parvoviral signs.

[7] Pancreatitis - Inflammation of the pancreas can lead to vomiting, anorexia, and abdominal pain.

[8] Hypoadrenocorticism - Also called Addison's disease, this endocrine disorder can cause gastrointestinal signs.

[9] Inflammatory bowel disease - Chronic inflammation of the intestines can cause intermittent vomiting and diarrhea.

Differentiating parvoviral enteritis from these other conditions often requires additional diagnostic testing, including fecal antigen or PCR for parvovirus, abdominal imaging, and laboratory analysis. A combination of clinical signs, patient history, and diagnostics is usually needed to reach a definitive diagnosis.
