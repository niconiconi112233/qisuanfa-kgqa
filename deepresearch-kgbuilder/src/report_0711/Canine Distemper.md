## Disease Overview

Canine distemper is a highly infectious, systemic, viral disease that occurs worldwide in dogs and a wide variety of other mammalian species. The epidemiology of the disease is complicated by the large number of susceptible species. [1]

Canine distemper virus, a paramyxovirus closely related to the viruses that cause measles and rinderpest, is the causative agent. Infection is mainly transmitted via airborne droplet secretions from infected animals. [1] 

The virus initially replicates in the lymphatic tissue of the respiratory tract, leading to a cell-associated viremia that infects various tissues including the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital, and central nervous systems. This can result in a range of clinical signs including fever, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal issues, and neurological complications. [1]

Diagnosis is based on recognition of the characteristic clinical signs along with confirmatory testing such as PCR or antibody detection. Treatment is primarily supportive, as there is no specific cure. Vaccination is an important preventive measure, as the disease remains a major threat to both domestic and wild canine populations. [1]

## Common Pathogens

Canine distemper is caused by a single-stranded RNA virus of the Paramyxoviridae family.[1] This highly contagious virus can infect a wide range of mammalian species, including dogs, ferrets, raccoons, skunks, and large cats.[2,3] 

The virus primarily spreads through exposure to infected respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated bodily fluids.[1,2] Once infected, dogs can exhibit a range of clinical signs affecting the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems.[2,3] These include fever, nasal/ocular discharge, coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, and neurological complications.

While vaccination has helped reduce the prevalence of canine distemper, the virus remains an important cause of infectious disease mortality in dogs.[3,4] Emerging viral strains have also shown increased neurotropism, leading to greater morbidity and mortality in some wildlife populations.[5]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Canine distemper is a highly infectious, systemic viral disease that can manifest with a wide range of clinical signs. The virus initially attacks the cells of the immune system, weakening the dog's defenses and making them more susceptible to secondary infections [1,2]. 

Early symptoms often include a transient fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite. This is followed by the development of respiratory signs such as nasal discharge, coughing, and pneumonia [1,2]. Gastrointestinal involvement can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration [1,2].

As the disease progresses, the virus can invade the central nervous system, causing neurological complications. These may include seizures, muscle twitching, incoordination, and paralysis [1-3]. The hardening of the footpads and nose, known as "hard pad disease", is another distinctive feature [1,2,5].

Overall, the clinical course can be variable, with some dogs exhibiting only mild symptoms, while others develop severe, life-threatening disease. The prognosis is generally guarded, especially in cases with pronounced neurological involvement [1,2].

## Diagnostic Methods

The diagnosis of canine distemper relies on a combination of clinical signs and laboratory testing. Dogs with multisystemic clinical signs involving the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and/or neurological systems should be suspected of having canine distemper, especially if they are unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination history. [1]

Confirmatory testing can be performed using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and antibody detection assays. RT-PCR can detect the presence of the canine distemper virus genetic material and is considered the current test of choice. [2,3] Antibody titers or ELISA tests can also be used to determine if the dog has an immune response to the virus. [1] 

Samples that can be tested include epithelial cells from the conjunctiva, trachea, nose, or urine, as well as the buffy coat of the blood. [1] Viral antigen tests using immunofluorescence or in situ hybridization on skin or footpad biopsies can also aid diagnosis. [1] At necropsy, histopathology and further molecular testing of tissues can provide a definitive diagnosis.

The main challenge in diagnosis is distinguishing natural infection from recent vaccination, as the highly sensitive RT-PCR may detect vaccine virus. The new Canine Distemper Virus Quant RT-PCR test can help differentiate these scenarios by providing a quantitative measure of viral load. [4] Levels below 105,000 viral particles are more likely due to vaccine virus, while levels above 1 million particles indicate wild-type infection. [4]

## Treatment Options

The treatment for canine distemper is primarily supportive care, as there is no direct antiviral treatment for the virus. Supportive care can include fluid therapy, antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections, medications to manage respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and anticonvulsants for neurological complications.[1] 

Specific treatment approaches depend on the stage and severity of the disease. For mild upper respiratory signs, dogs may be treated with doxycycline and topical antibiotics for the eyes and nose.[1] Dogs with more severe systemic signs may require subcutaneous or intravenous fluid therapy, anti-nausea medications, and broader spectrum antibiotics.[1] In cases with lower respiratory involvement, oxygen therapy and nebulization may be needed.[1] For neurological complications like seizures or tremors, phenobarbital, levetiracetam, or methocarbamol may be administered.[1]

While there is no cure, the patient's own immune response is crucial to resolving the infection. With prompt, aggressive supportive care, some dogs may recover completely from the multisystemic signs, though neurological issues may persist even after other symptoms have resolved.[2] Unfortunately, treatment for acute neurological manifestations is often unsuccessful, and the prognosis for dogs with severe neurological involvement is guarded to poor.[2]

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent canine distemper. Puppies should undergo an initial vaccination series starting at 6-8 weeks of age, with boosters given every 3-4 weeks until 16-20 weeks of age. [1] After the initial puppy series, adult dogs should receive booster vaccines every 1-3 years to maintain immunity. [2]

In addition to vaccination, good hygiene and disinfection practices are important. The canine distemper virus is relatively unstable outside the host, and can be killed by common household disinfectants. [3] Cleaning and disinfection protocols at kennels, shelters, and veterinary facilities are crucial to prevent the spread of the virus.

Limiting exposure of puppies and unvaccinated dogs to high-risk environments like dog parks, kennels, and areas with known wildlife reservoirs can also help reduce the risk of infection. [4] Separating infected dogs from healthy ones is essential to contain outbreaks.

## Differential Diagnosis

Canine distemper is a highly contagious viral disease that can manifest with a wide range of clinical signs, making it an important differential diagnosis for various conditions affecting dogs. Several other diseases should be considered when evaluating a dog with suspected canine distemper.

[1] Canine Parvovirus Infection (CPV)
Similarities: Both CPV and canine distemper can cause gastrointestinal signs such as vomiting and diarrhea, as well as lethargy and dehydration. Neurologic complications may also occur in some cases.
Key Differences: CPV primarily affects the gastrointestinal and hematopoietic systems, while canine distemper has a broader tropism, involving the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic systems. Laboratory tests can help distinguish between the two infections.

[2] Infectious Canine Hepatitis (ICH) 
Similarities: ICH, like canine distemper, can cause systemic illness with fever, lethargy, and respiratory signs.
Key Differences: ICH primarily affects the liver, causing jaundice, while canine distemper has a more varied clinical presentation without the characteristic hepatic involvement.

[3] Canine Influenza Virus (CIV) Infection
Similarities: CIV and canine distemper both cause respiratory signs such as cough, nasal discharge, and pneumonia.
Key Differences: CIV is a strictly respiratory pathogen, while canine distemper has a multisystemic nature, often involving the gastrointestinal and neurologic systems.

[4] Bordetella bronchiseptica Infection (Kennel Cough)
Similarities: Bordetella bronchiseptica, a common cause of kennel cough, can produce respiratory signs similar to those seen in canine distemper.
Key Differences: Kennel cough is a localized respiratory infection, while canine distemper has a broader, systemic involvement.

[5] Neurological Disorders
Similarities: Canine distemper can cause various neurologic signs, including seizures, tremors, and paralysis, which may resemble other neurological conditions.
Key Differentiations: Neurologic signs in canine distemper are often preceded by systemic illness, while other neurological disorders may present without such a history.

[6] Leptospirosis
Similarities: Leptospirosis can cause fever, lethargy, vomiting, and diarrhea, similar to the gastrointestinal signs of canine distemper.
Key Differences: Leptospirosis primarily affects the kidneys and liver, while canine distemper has a broader range of organ involvement.

[7] Rabies
Similarities: Rabies, like canine distemper, can cause neurologic signs such as seizures and paralysis.
Key Differences: Rabies is a fatal, progressive encephalomyelitis, while canine distemper may have a more variable neurologic course and prognosis.

Accurate diagnosis of canine distemper relies on a combination of clinical signs, history, and diagnostic testing, including virus detection (PCR, antigen testing) and serology. Differentiating canine distemper from these other conditions is crucial for appropriate treatment and management.
