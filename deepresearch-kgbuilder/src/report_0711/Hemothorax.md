## Disease Overview

Hemothorax is a condition characterized by the presence of blood within the pleural cavity, the space between the lungs and the chest wall [1]. It is a serious medical condition that can occur in companion animals, often as a result of trauma such as automobile accidents or animal fights [2,3]. 

Hemothorax can develop when blood vessels in the chest, such as the internal thoracic, intercostal, or internal mammary vessels, become damaged and leak blood into the pleural space [1]. This leakage of blood can compromise lung function and lead to hypovolemic shock if left untreated [1,2]. 

While trauma is the most common cause of hemothorax in dogs and cats, rare cases of spontaneous hemothorax have also been reported, such as those associated with thymic hemorrhage or involution [4,5]. Regardless of the underlying cause, prompt diagnosis and management are critical to ensure the best possible outcome for affected animals.

## Common Pathogens

Hemothorax in dogs and cats can have a variety of causes, including both viral and bacterial pathogens as well as non-infectious factors [1,2,3].

One common cause is trauma, such as blunt force injuries or penetrating wounds that damage blood vessels in the thorax [1,2]. Bleeding from damaged arteries, veins, or organs within the chest cavity can lead to the accumulation of blood (hemothorax) [1,2].

Coagulation disorders, both inherited and acquired, can also result in hemothorax by impairing the body's ability to form blood clots and stop bleeding [1,2]. Anticoagulant rodenticide ingestion is a common cause of acquired coagulopathy leading to hemothorax in pets [1,2].

In some cases, neoplasia (cancer) involving the lungs, pleura, or other thoracic structures can erode into blood vessels and cause bleeding into the pleural space [1,2,3]. Common tumor types associated with hemothorax include hemangiosarcoma, mesothelioma, and metastatic carcinomas [1,2].

Certain infectious diseases have also been linked to hemothorax in dogs and cats. These include parasitic infestations like dirofilariasis, angiostrongylosis, and spirocercosis, as well as bacterial infections such as Streptococcus zooepidemicus [1,2,3]. The pathogens can damage blood vessels or impair normal hemostasis, leading to pleural bleeding.

Iatrogenic causes, such as complications from thoracocentesis, thoracic surgery, or vascular catheter placement, can also result in hemothorax in some cases [1,2].

In summary, the major causes of hemothorax in companion animals include traumatic injuries, coagulation disorders, neoplasia, and certain infectious diseases, as well as iatrogenic factors. Identifying and addressing the underlying etiology is crucial in the management of this potentially life-threatening condition.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Hemothorax in dogs and cats can present with both acute and chronic symptoms. Acute onset is typically characterized by signs of decreased blood volume, such as impaired respiration/respiratory distress, pale mucous membranes, weakness, collapse, weak and rapid pulse, and dull breathing sounds [1,2]. 

Hemothorax is often associated with an underlying cause, such as trauma, blood clotting disorders, neoplasia, or other conditions. Trauma is a common cause, leading to bleeding from blood vessels in the thoracic wall, spine, heart, lungs, thymus, or diaphragm [1,2]. Rodenticide ingestion can also result in coagulopathy and subsequent hemothorax [1,2]. Other reported causes include herniated abdominal organs, lung lobe torsion, acute thymic hemorrhage, and iatrogenic injury during procedures like thoracocentesis [1,2].

Concurrent injuries are common, with pulmonary contusions and pneumothorax frequently observed [1]. Patients may initially present in hypovolemic shock due to the blood loss into the pleural space, before developing respiratory compromise as the pleural effusion accumulates [1,2].

## Diagnostic Methods

The diagnosis of a hemothorax is defined as the accumulation of blood in the pleural space with a packed cell volume (PCV) that is at least 25% of peripheral blood.[1] Thoracic point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) can provide a rapid diagnosis of pleural effusion, and the fluid in the chest should be sampled and analyzed to confirm the presence of blood.[2] 

X-rays are crucial for visualizing the extent of the fluid build-up in the chest, the collapse of lung lobes, and any masses which might be present in the chest cavity.[3] An ultrasound of the chest can reveal a diseased condition with an even greater sensitivity than an x-ray image.[3] 

If the patient has normal clotting parameters, the bleeding into the chest will often stop on its own as blood clots form.[1] However, a computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast may be needed to identify the source of the bleeding, such as a vascular injury or a ruptured thoracic tumor.[1]

## Treatment Options

Hemothorax in dogs and cats requires prompt veterinary care to manage the underlying cause and stabilize the patient. The primary treatment approach involves managing hypovolemic shock, respiratory distress, and ongoing hemorrhage.

Fluid resuscitation is crucial to address blood loss and hypovolemia. Crystalloids, colloids, and blood products like packed red blood cells or whole blood may be needed to restore circulating volume and oxygen-carrying capacity. Careful monitoring and adjustments are required to avoid fluid overload.

For respiratory compromise, thoracocentesis can be performed to remove blood from the pleural space and allow the lungs to re-expand. However, only the minimum amount of fluid should be removed to avoid re-accumulation. In some cases, thoracostomy tube placement may be required for ongoing drainage.

In patients with ongoing or severe hemorrhage, surgical exploration and control of the bleeding source may be necessary. This could include repair of injured vasculature or removal of a bleeding neoplastic mass. Medications to improve clotting, such as plasma or vitamin K, may also be indicated in coagulopathic patients.

Throughout treatment, supportive care is vital. Oxygen therapy, warming, and pain management help stabilize the patient. Regular monitoring and follow-up are needed to ensure the underlying condition is resolved and prevent recurrence of the hemothorax.

## Preventive Measures

To prevent hemothorax in pets, pet owners should take the following precautions:

[1] Vaccination: Ensure pets are up-to-date on all recommended vaccinations, as some infectious diseases can lead to hemothorax.[2] Environmental management: Keep pets indoors or in secure, fenced areas to prevent trauma from accidents or altercations with other animals.[3] Monitoring for underlying conditions: Regular veterinary check-ups can help identify and manage conditions like neoplasia or coagulopathies that may predispose pets to spontaneous hemothorax.[4] Immediate veterinary care: Seek prompt medical attention if a pet experiences any trauma to the chest, as this can cause hemothorax that requires rapid diagnosis and treatment.

## Differential Diagnosis

Hemothorax in dogs can have a variety of underlying causes. Some of the key differential diagnoses to consider include:

[1] Trauma - Hemothorax can result from traumatic injuries that lacerate the lung parenchyma or rupture intrathoracic vessels, such as from a car accident, penetrating injury, or blunt force trauma. [2]

[2] Coagulopathies - Disorders of primary or secondary hemostasis, such as anticoagulant rodenticide toxicity, can lead to spontaneous hemothorax. [3,4] 

[3] Neoplasia - Various thoracic neoplasms, including hemangiosarcoma, mesothelioma, and pulmonary carcinoma, can cause hemorrhage into the pleural space. A study found neoplasia was the most common cause of non-coagulopathic spontaneous hemothorax in dogs. [4]

[4] Infectious or parasitic diseases - Conditions like dirofilariasis, streptococcal pneumonia, and angiostrongylosis can all predispose dogs to developing hemothorax. [4,6-8]

[5] Lung lobe torsion - This condition has been reported as a cause of hemothorax in both dogs and cats. [4,11-13]

[6] Iatrogenic - Hemothorax can occur secondary to procedures like thoracocentesis, thoracic surgery, jugular catheter placement, or feeding tube removal. [2,4]

Given the patient's age, concurrent hemorrhagic effusion, and lack of known trauma, neoplasia was considered the most likely underlying cause prior to further diagnostics. However, advanced imaging ultimately revealed a vascular avulsion injury as the source of the hemothorax in this case.
