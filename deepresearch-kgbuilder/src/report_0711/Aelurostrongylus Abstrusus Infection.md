## Disease Overview

Aelurostrongylus abstrusus, also known as the feline or cat lungworm, is a metastrongyle nematode that infects the respiratory system of domestic and wild felids worldwide [1,2]. It has an indirect life cycle, utilizing gastropods (snails and slugs) as intermediate hosts, and various vertebrates as paratenic hosts [3,4]. 

Adult female worms lay eggs in the lungs, which hatch into first-stage larvae (L1) that migrate up the respiratory tract and are coughed up, swallowed, and passed in the cat's feces [3]. The L1s then infect gastropod intermediate hosts, where they develop into infective third-stage larvae (L3) [3,4]. Cats typically become infected by ingesting these L3-infected gastropods or paratenic hosts like birds, rodents, and reptiles that have eaten the infected gastropods [2,3].

Clinical signs in cats range from asymptomatic to severe, including coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, dyspnea, and respiratory distress, depending on the worm burden and immune status of the host [1,2]. Diagnosis is made by detecting L1s in fecal samples, though recovery may be inconsistent [1,5]. Treatment options include anthelmintic drugs like fenbendazole, imidacloprid/moxidectin, emodepside/praziquantel, and selamectin [1,17-19]. Prevention focuses on limiting cats' exposure to intermediate and paratenic hosts [1].

## Common Pathogens

*Aelurostrongylus abstrusus* is the most well-known and common lungworm parasite infecting domestic cats worldwide [1,2]. Other respiratory parasites infecting cats include *Troglostrongylus brevior*, *Troglostrongylus subcrenatus*, *Oslerus rostratus*, and *Eucoleus aerophilus* (syn. *Capillaria aerophila*) [1,2]. 

*Aelurostrongylus abstrusus* has an indirect life cycle involving gastropods as intermediate hosts and various vertebrates (e.g. rodents, birds, reptiles) as paratenic hosts [3,4]. Cats become infected by ingesting gastropods or paratenic hosts containing infective third-stage larvae (L3) [3,4]. 

*Troglostrongylus brevior* and *Oslerus rostratus* also have indirect life cycles utilizing gastropods and paratenic hosts, while *Eucoleus aerophilus* has a direct life cycle with infective eggs being consumed in food or water [1,2,5]. 

Feline lungworm infections can range from asymptomatic to severe respiratory disease, with clinical signs including coughing, dyspnea, and tachypnea [6,7]. Diagnosis is challenging, as larval detection in feces can be intermittent and may miss pre-patent infections [8,9]. Serology has emerged as a sensitive alternative diagnostic approach for detecting *Aelurostrongylus abstrusus* infections [10-12].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Feline aelurostrongylosis, caused by the metastrongyloid nematode *Aelurostrongylus abstrusus*, can present with a wide range of clinical symptoms and signs in infected cats. Many infected cats may be asymptomatic, while others can exhibit moderate to severe respiratory distress. [1,2]

Common clinical signs include coughing, nasal discharge, dyspnea, wheezing, and sneezing. [1,2] Some cats may also experience anorexia, weight loss, and lethargy. [1,2] In severe cases, the infection can lead to bronchopneumonia and even death. [1,4] 

The severity of clinical signs depends on factors such as the worm burden, the cat's immune status, and the stage of infection. [1,2] Cats may initially show mild signs that can progress to more severe respiratory distress as the infection advances. [1,4]

It is important to note that the clinical presentation of feline aelurostrongylosis can mimic other respiratory diseases, such as feline bronchial disease or asthma, verminous pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and pulmonary contusion. [1,2] Therefore, a thorough diagnostic workup is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosis of Aelurostrongylus Abstrusus Infection in cats typically involves several approaches:

[1] Fecal examination - First-stage larvae can be detected in the feces using techniques like direct fecal smear, fecal flotation, or the Baermann method. The Baermann method is considered the most sensitive, as it allows recovery of live, motile larvae that have a distinctive S-shaped, kinked tail with a dorsal spine. [2,14,15]

[2] Bronchoalveolar lavage - Lung fluid obtained via bronchoalveolar lavage may contain first-stage larvae, though the number present is often lower than in fecal samples. Cytological examination of lung aspirates can also sometimes reveal the larvae. [15]

[3] Serology - An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been investigated as an alternative diagnostic tool, though its sensitivity and specificity compared to fecal examination remains to be fully determined. [16] 

[4] Molecular testing - PCR assays have been developed to differentiate between various species of lungworms infecting cats, including Aelurostrongylus abstrusus, Troglostrongylus brevior, and Angiostrongylus chabaudi. [1]

[5] Radiography - Thoracic radiographs may show alveolar changes and thickening of bronchial walls, but the findings can depend on the number of worms present and duration of infection. [1]

In summary, a combination of diagnostic approaches is often required to confirm Aelurostrongylus abstrusus infection, as false negatives can occur with any single test. Careful consideration of the cat's history, clinical signs, and results of multiple diagnostic tests are recommended. [2,15,16]

## Treatment Options

Aelurostrongylus abstrusus infection in cats can be treated with a variety of anthelmintic medications. Some recommended treatments include:

[1] Ivermectin: 0.4 mg/kg subcutaneously, repeated in 2 weeks. Ivermectin has been shown to be effective in clearing A. abstrusus infections in cats.

[2] Selamectin: 6 mg/kg topically, administered once. Selamectin spot-on treatment has also been reported to be effective against A. abstrusus.

[3] Fenbendazole: 50 mg/kg orally, once daily for 10-14 days. Fenbendazole is another anthelmintic drug that can be used to treat A. abstrusus infections in cats.

[4] Emodepside/praziquantel: Spot-on application of this combination product has demonstrated efficacy against adult A. abstrusus nematodes in experimentally infected cats.

[5] Moxidectin: Topical administration of moxidectin-containing products has been shown to help prevent A. abstrusus infections in experimental studies.

In addition to the anthelmintic therapy, supportive care such as anti-inflammatory medications and bronchodilators may be beneficial in managing the clinical signs associated with heavy A. abstrusus infections. Careful monitoring and repeated treatments may be required, as larvae can continue to be shed for some time after the initial treatment.

## Preventive Measures

Preventing Aelurostrongylus Abstrusus infection in cats involves a combination of vaccination, isolation, and environmental management strategies.

Vaccination is not currently available for Aelurostrongylus Abstrusus, so prevention focuses on reducing exposure to the parasite's intermediate and paratenic hosts. [1] Keeping cats indoors and preventing them from hunting and ingesting rodents, birds, amphibians, and reptiles can help minimize the risk of infection. [2,3] Additionally, controlling the populations of snails and slugs in the environment, which serve as the parasite's intermediate hosts, may reduce transmission. [3]

Proper sanitation and hygiene measures are also important. Regularly cleaning the cat's living area, properly disposing of feces, and avoiding contact with potential intermediate/paratenic hosts can help prevent transmission. [2] In areas where Aelurostrongylus Abstrusus is endemic, routine fecal testing and preventive deworming may be recommended for cats, especially those with outdoor access. [4]

## Differential Diagnosis

Respiratory parasitoses of cats are often challenging to diagnose clinically because other conditions present with similar signs. Differential diagnoses include bacterial infections, other parasitic infections such as pulmonary toxoplasmosis, respiratory mycoses, feline bronchial disease/asthma, airway foreign bodies and pulmonary tumors.[11,16] Signs caused by _A abstrusus_ can be identical to those associated with feline bronchial disease/asthma.[16] Furthermore, treatment for bronchial disease/asthma with corticosteroids and bronchodilators may produce a clinical recovery in cats with respiratory parasitoses; thus veterinarians have no reason to suspect a misdiagnosis.[3,16] There is no evidence at the moment, but it is likely that similar confusion might arise in cats infected with _T brevior_.

Features of radiographic examinations are not pathognomonic for aelurostrongylosis.[57,58] The most common findings in cats infected by _A abstrusus_ and _T brevior_ are an alveolar pattern followed by bronchial and interstitial patterns, bronchial wall thickening and increased interstitial opacity ([Figure 5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11148874/figure/fig5-1098612X15623113/)), depending on the worm burden and the chronicity of infection.

# Pet Disease: Aelurostrongylus Abstrusus Infection

Aelurostrongylus abstrusus, the feline lungworm, is a widespread parasite that can cause severe respiratory disease in cats. This report synthesizes the latest research on the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this important infection. Key findings include the complex life cycle involving gastropod intermediate hosts, the wide range of clinical signs from asymptomatic to life-threatening, and the need for a multi-modal diagnostic approach. Effective treatment options are available, but preventing exposure through environmental management is crucial for controlling aelurostrongylosis in cats.

## Conclusion

Aelurostrongylus abstrusus infection in cats presents significant diagnostic and management challenges. While a variety of anthelmintic drugs can effectively treat the parasite, prevention through environmental control of intermediate hosts and limiting cats' exposure is essential. Clinicians must remain vigilant in differentiating aelurostrongylosis from other feline respiratory diseases, as the clinical signs can be nonspecific. Continued research on improved diagnostics and prophylactic strategies will help veterinarians better combat this important parasitic infection.
