## Disease Overview

Feline upper respiratory infection (FURI) is a common condition in cats, often caused by a combination of viral and bacterial pathogens. The key points from the provided sources are:

[1] Epidemiological investigation of 1,158 cats with FURI in Wuhan, China found:
- Feline calicivirus (FCV) was the most common pathogen, detected in 40.2% of samples
- Mycoplasma felis was the second most common, detected in 26.9% of samples 
- Feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) was detected in 15.5% and Chlamydia felis in 7.3%
- Single pathogen infections were most common (66.3%), with double, triple and quadruple infections also identified

[2] FURI is a highly prevalent syndrome in cats, especially those in shelters or close-contact situations. Multiple viruses (FCV, FHV-1), bacteria (Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Bordetella) and host/environmental factors can contribute to disease.

[3] Common clinical signs of FURI include ocular/nasal discharge, sneezing, coughing, conjunctivitis, and oral ulcers. More severe signs like pneumonia, fever, and lethargy can also occur, especially in young animals.

[4] FURI poses challenges for diagnosis, as the clinical signs can overlap between different infectious agents. Co-infections are common and may lead to more severe disease compared to single pathogen infections.

In summary, FURI is a multifactorial disease with a complex etiology involving both viral and bacterial pathogens. Understanding the epidemiology and the impact of co-infections on disease severity is important for improving diagnosis, treatment and prevention strategies.

## Common Pathogens

The most common viruses that cause upper respiratory infections in cats are feline herpesvirus type-1 (also known as feline viral rhinotracheitis or FVR) and feline calicivirus (FCV) [1]. The most common bacteria that cause upper respiratory infections in cats are Bordetella bronchiseptica (B. bronchiseptica) and Chlamydophila felis (C. felis) [1]. Less common agents that may be involved include mycoplasma or feline reovirus [1].

FVR and FCV are responsible for approximately 90% of all feline upper respiratory infections [1]. Cats that are infected with these viruses may become chronic carriers and continue to shed the virus, even if they appear healthy [1]. Stress can reactivate the FVR virus in cats [1]. FCV infects about half of cats, and some may continue to shed the virus for months or even life, even without showing symptoms [1].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Feline upper respiratory infection typically presents with a variety of clinical symptoms and signs:

[1] Sneezing, nasal congestion, and nasal discharge are very common. The discharge may start as clear but can become colored or purulent (containing pus) as the infection progresses.

[2] Conjunctivitis (inflammation of the membranes around the eyes) and eye discharge are also frequent symptoms. Cats may squint or rub at their eyes due to the irritation.

[3] Affected cats often develop oral ulcers and may have difficulty eating due to pain. They may show signs of depression and lethargy.

[4] In more severe cases, cats can develop coughing, difficulty breathing, and fever. This may indicate the infection has spread to the lower respiratory tract.

[5] Decreased appetite is common, as the nasal congestion and oral pain can make it difficult for the cat to smell and eat their food.

The clinical presentation can vary depending on the specific infectious agent causing the upper respiratory infection. Feline herpesvirus and calicivirus are the most common culprits, but other bacteria and fungi can also be involved. The severity of symptoms also depends on the cat's age, immune status, and overall health.

## Diagnostic Methods

Feline upper respiratory infection is typically diagnosed based on the characteristic clinical signs observed during a physical examination by a veterinarian. Common diagnostic methods include:

[1] Clinical signs: Veterinarians can often identify an upper respiratory infection based on symptoms such as sneezing, nasal/eye discharge, coughing, fever, and lethargy. [1,2,4,5]

[2] Laboratory testing: Additional diagnostic tests may be recommended to identify the specific causative agent, including:
- Nasal/ocular swabs for PCR testing to detect viruses like feline herpesvirus and calicivirus, as well as bacteria like Chlamydophila and Bordetella. [2,3,6,7]
- Bacterial culture and sensitivity testing of nasal/eye discharge to identify bacterial infections. [2]
- Blood tests to check for underlying conditions that could predispose the cat to respiratory infection. [1,2]

[3] Imaging: In some cases, X-rays or CT scans may be recommended to evaluate the lungs and upper airway structures for signs of pneumonia or other complications. [2]

By combining the cat's clinical presentation with targeted laboratory testing, veterinarians can typically identify the cause of the upper respiratory infection and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Prompt diagnosis and management are important to prevent the infection from progressing or spreading to other cats.

## Treatment Options

Feline upper respiratory infections are typically treated with a combination of supportive care and targeted medications, depending on the underlying cause. Viral infections like feline herpesvirus and calicivirus often require symptomatic treatment, while bacterial infections may need antibiotics.[1]

Supportive care measures can include:

- Ensuring the cat stays hydrated and maintaining food intake, which may require appetite stimulants or feeding highly palatable canned food[1]
- Providing humidified air to help with nasal congestion[1] 
- Gently cleaning discharge from the eyes and nose[1]
- Reducing stress and environmental changes that could worsen symptoms[1]

Medications used to manage feline upper respiratory infections include:

- Antiviral drugs like famciclovir for treating feline herpesvirus infections[3]
- Antibiotics like doxycycline or amoxicillin-clavulanate for bacterial infections[1]
- Topical ocular medications for eye infections[1]
- Corticosteroids or antihistamines to reduce inflammation in some cases[1]
- Lysine supplements, which may help in managing chronic feline herpesvirus infections[3]

Vaccination is an important preventive measure, as core vaccines for feline calicivirus and herpesvirus can help reduce the severity of infection if exposure occurs.[1,5] Proper hygiene, isolation of infected cats, and reducing stress are also key to preventing the spread of upper respiratory infections in multi-cat households.[1,5]

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is a key preventive measure for feline upper respiratory infection. A combination feline parvovirus (FPV), FHV-1, and FCV vaccine is recommended for all cats, beginning as early as 6 to 8 weeks of age, regardless of vaccine type [1]. This combination vaccine helps protect against the most common viral causes of upper respiratory disease in cats.

For cats at higher risk, such as those in high-density environments like shelters or boarding facilities, the veterinarian may also recommend vaccination against Chlamydophila felis and Bordetella bronchiseptica [1]. These vaccines can help reduce the severity of clinical signs, even if they do not provide complete protection against infection.

In addition to vaccination, isolating infected cats from healthy cats and maintaining good environmental hygiene are important steps to prevent the spread of upper respiratory infections. Cleaning and disinfecting food and water bowls, litter boxes, and other shared surfaces can help limit transmission via fomites [2,3]. Adequate ventilation in high-density housing is also key to reducing disease transmission [1].

## Differential Diagnosis

The main differential diagnoses for feline upper respiratory infection include:

[1] Feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) - This virus can cause conjunctivitis, rhinitis, and oral ulceration. Cats may develop recurrent disease due to viral latency and reactivation.[1,2]

[2] Feline calicivirus (FCV) - FCV is a common cause of upper respiratory signs, especially oral ulceration. Some strains can also cause more severe systemic disease.[1,2] 

[3] Chlamydia felis - This bacteria primarily causes conjunctivitis in cats, often with mild upper respiratory signs.[5]

[4] Mycoplasma spp. - These bacteria have been associated with rhinitis and conjunctivitis in cats.[5] 

[5] Bordetella bronchiseptica - This bacteria can cause more severe lower respiratory tract disease, especially in kittens and cats in crowded environments.[6]

[6] Fungal infections - Cryptococcosis and aspergillosis can both cause nasal disease in cats.[5]

[7] Foreign bodies - Plant material or other objects lodged in the nasal cavity can cause sneezing and nasal discharge.[16]

[8] Neoplasia - Nasal or nasopharyngeal tumors, such as lymphoma and carcinoma, can lead to upper respiratory signs.[16]

Careful diagnostics are often needed to identify the underlying cause, as many of these conditions have overlapping clinical signs. PCR testing, cytology, imaging, and other advanced diagnostics may be required.

# Feline Upper Respiratory Infection

Feline upper respiratory infection (FURI) is a common and complex disease in cats, caused by a combination of viral and bacterial pathogens. Understanding the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic approaches is crucial for effective management and prevention. This report synthesizes key insights from authoritative sources on the various aspects of FURI.

## Summary

FURI is primarily driven by feline calicivirus (FCV) and feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), which account for the majority of cases. Other bacterial agents like Mycoplasma felis, Chlamydia felis, and Bordetella bronchiseptica can also contribute to the disease. Clinical signs include sneezing, nasal/ocular discharge, conjunctivitis, oral ulcers, and fever, with the potential for more severe complications like pneumonia. Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical presentation and targeted laboratory testing, such as PCR and bacterial culture.

Treatment focuses on supportive care, including maintaining hydration and nutrition, as well as targeted medications like antivirals, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatories. Vaccination against the core viral pathogens is a critical preventive measure, especially for high-risk cats. Proper hygiene, isolation of infected animals, and environmental management are also essential to limit the spread of FURI in multi-cat settings.
