## Disease Overview

Intussusception is a condition where a segment of the intestine becomes telescoped into an adjacent segment. It is a common cause of bowel obstruction in small animals. The primary causes of intussusception are often unclear, but it can be associated with conditions that lead to increased intestinal motility, such as intestinal parasitism, infectious enteritis, metabolic disorders, foreign bodies, or intestinal masses. [1,2] Intussusception is most common in young animals under 1 year of age, but can also occur in older animals, sometimes associated with intestinal neoplasia. [3] The condition starts with partial bowel obstruction that can progress to complete obstruction, leading to vascular compromise, ischemia, and potential perforation of the affected intestinal segment. [1,2]

## Common Pathogens

Intussusception can be caused by a variety of viral and bacterial infections that lead to abnormal intestinal motility. Some key pathogens linked to intussusception in dogs and cats include:

Viral infections: Intussusception is often associated with viral enteritis caused by pathogens like parvovirus, coronavirus, and calicivirus [1,2]. These viruses can lead to inflammation and increased intestinal motility, predisposing the animal to intussusception.

Bacterial infections: Bacterial infections such as Salmonella, Clostridium, and E. coli can also cause inflammation and altered intestinal motility, contributing to intussusception [1,2]. These bacterial pathogens may infect the intestines directly or release toxins that disrupt normal gut function.

In addition to infectious causes, intussusception can also be triggered by other factors that lead to hyperperistalsis, such as intestinal parasites, metabolic disorders, foreign bodies, previous surgical procedures, and intestinal masses [1,3,4]. However, the original cause is often unclear.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Intussusception is a common condition in puppies and kittens, often associated with severe diarrhea or the ingestion of something that becomes stuck in the small intestines [1]. As the intestines contract to move food and fluid through the tract, a segment can telescope into an adjoining segment, causing an obstruction [1].

The clinical signs of intussusception can vary, but often include vomiting, diarrhea (sometimes bloody), abdominal pain, and the presence of a palpable abdominal mass [2,3]. Other symptoms like depression, anorexia, and emaciation may also be present, especially in chronic cases [3]. Tenesmus and hematochezia are more commonly seen with ileocaecocolic intussusceptions [3]. Rectal prolapse of the invaginated segment can also occur [3].

The severity and type of clinical signs depend on the location of the intussusception, whether the obstruction is partial or complete, the vascular integrity, and the duration of the condition [3]. Radiographic signs of intestinal obstruction may not always be present, especially in partial or chronic cases [3,4].

## Diagnostic Methods

Intussusception in dogs typically presents with nonspecific clinical signs such as depression, anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea. A palpable abdominal mass may be detected in over 50% of cases [1]. Radiographic imaging can reveal signs of intestinal obstruction, though these may not be present with partial or chronic intussusceptions [2,3]. 

Ultrasonography is considered the gold standard diagnostic tool for intussusception. The characteristic "target" or "bulls-eye" appearance with multiple concentric layers is often visualized on transverse ultrasound images [3,4]. Doppler ultrasound can also be used to assess the viability of the involved intestine, as those with preserved blood flow are more likely to be manually reducible [4].

In cases where the diagnosis is unclear, barium contrast studies may be considered, but caution is advised as leakage can lead to severe peritonitis [3]. Overall, a combination of physical exam findings, imaging techniques, and surgical exploration are often required to definitively diagnose and manage intussusception in dogs.

## Treatment Options

Intussusception is a surgical emergency that requires prompt treatment. The primary treatment approaches include:

[1] Exploratory laparotomy and manual reduction: The veterinarian will perform an abdominal incision to examine the gastrointestinal tract. If the affected intestinal segment is viable, they may attempt to manually reduce the intussusception by gently applying traction on the intussusceptum and pressure on the intussuscipiens. [2]

[2] Resection and anastomosis: If the affected intestinal segment is not viable or cannot be manually reduced, the veterinarian will surgically remove the necrotic or irreducible portion and reconnect the healthy ends of the intestine. This is the most common surgical intervention, occurring in up to 82% of cases. [3]

Supportive care is critical, including intravenous fluids, electrolyte replacement, and pain management. [5] Recurrence is a common post-surgical complication, occurring in 11-20% of cases. [4] To prevent recurrence, the veterinarian may perform an enteroplication procedure, which involves suturing adjacent segments of intestine together. However, this approach has its own risks, including an increased susceptibility to other intestinal obstructions. [4]

Overall, the prognosis for intussusception is good in uncomplicated cases, as long as the underlying cause can be addressed and recurrence prevented. Careful monitoring and nursing care are essential for a successful recovery. [2,3,5]

## Preventive Measures

Intussusception is a serious condition in pets that requires prompt surgical intervention. While some cases may resolve spontaneously, prevention is crucial to avoid complications and recurrence.

One key preventive measure is enteroplication, also known as enteroenteropexy. This procedure involves suturing adjacent loops of intestine together to help prevent the affected section from re-invaginating. Studies have shown that enteroplication can be an effective way to reduce the risk of recurrence in dogs and cats.[1][2] 

Additionally, managing any underlying conditions that may predispose an animal to intussusception is important. This includes treating intestinal parasites, infectious enteritis, metabolic disorders, or removing foreign bodies that could cause increased intestinal motility.[3] Carefully monitoring younger pets, especially those under one year of age, is advisable as they are at higher risk.

While intussusception cannot always be prevented, these measures can help reduce the likelihood of this life-threatening condition and improve outcomes for affected pets.

## Differential Diagnosis

Intussusception is a common cause of gastrointestinal obstruction in dogs and cats, but other diseases can present with similar symptoms. The key differential diagnoses to consider include:

[1] Foreign body obstruction - Ingestion of indigestible objects can cause partial or complete intestinal blockage, leading to vomiting, abdominal pain, and other signs of obstruction. [2]

[2] Intestinal masses or neoplasia - Tumors or growths within the intestinal tract can also cause obstruction and mimic intussusception, especially in older animals. [2]

[3] Intestinal parasites - Severe infestations with intestinal worms, particularly in young animals, can trigger increased intestinal motility and lead to intussusception. [1]

[4] Inflammatory bowel disease - Chronic inflammation of the intestines can cause swelling, spasms, and obstruction, sometimes leading to intussusception. [2]

[5] Congenital intestinal abnormalities - Anatomical defects like intestinal malrotation or duplication cysts may predispose animals to intussusception. [2]

[6] Motility disorders - Conditions affecting intestinal peristalsis, like paralysis or dyssynergia, can contribute to the development of intussusception. [2]

Careful physical examination, imaging studies, and potentially endoscopy or exploratory surgery may be necessary to differentiate intussusception from these other potential causes of gastrointestinal obstruction.
