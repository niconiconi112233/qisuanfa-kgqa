## Disease Overview

Surra is a disease caused by the blood-borne parasite Trypanosoma evansi and transmitted by biting flies. It can affect a wide range of domestic and wild animals, including horses, donkeys, mules, deer, camels, llamas, dogs, cats, and more [1,2,3]. 

The disease is characterized by symptoms such as fever, anemia, weight loss, edema, and neurological issues in severe cases [1,2,3]. It can be acute and rapidly fatal, especially in highly susceptible species like horses and camels, or chronic and long-lasting [1,2]. Surra is endemic in parts of Africa, Asia, Central and South America [1,2,3].

Transmission occurs primarily through the bites of various biting flies, particularly horseflies and stable flies [1,2,3]. Vampire bats can also transmit the parasite in some regions [1]. The incubation period is typically 5-60 days [3]. While humans possess some innate resistance to T. evansi, rare clinical cases have been reported, often in individuals with genetic anomalies [2,3].

## Common Pathogens

Surra is caused by the protozoal parasite Trypanosoma evansi, which belongs to the subgenus Trypanozoon and Salivarian section [1]. T. evansi is closely related to both Trypanosoma equiperdum, which causes dourine, and T. brucei, one of the causative agents of African trypanosomiasis [1,5]. There is ongoing debate about whether T. evansi and T. equiperdum should be considered distinct species from T. brucei [1,5].

T. evansi has a wide host range and can infect all domestic animals as well as many other mammals, including various large ungulates, suids, felids, canids, primates, lagomorphs, small mammals, and bats [1,4]. The principal hosts and reservoirs can differ by region, but camels, equids, water buffalo, and cattle are generally considered the major domestic hosts [1,4]. Many wild mammals, such as vampire bats and capybara, can also act as reservoirs [1,4]. 

While T. evansi is not considered a significant zoonosis, rare clinical cases have been reported in humans, potentially in individuals with genetic anomalies or other factors that make them unusually susceptible [1,2,9,10].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Surra, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma evansi, is characterized by a variety of nonspecific clinical signs in a wide range of domestic animals [1]. The most common symptoms include:

- Intermittent fever: Animals experience recurrent episodes of fever during the course of the disease [1].
- Anemia: Surra often leads to a progressive, regenerative anemia in infected animals [1,2].
- Weight loss and wasting: Infected animals typically show gradual weight loss and emaciation over time [1,2].

Other common clinical signs include:

- Lethargy and weakness [1,2]
- Edema, especially in the lower body parts such as the legs, brisket, and abdomen [1,2] 
- Jaundice and signs of hemorrhage (e.g. petechial hemorrhages on mucous membranes) [1]
- Neurological signs like ataxia and paresis, especially in horses [1]
- Reproductive problems like abortion in pregnant animals [1,2]

The severity of illness can vary greatly depending on the animal species, with horses, camels, and dogs being highly susceptible and often developing acute, life-threatening disease [1,2]. In contrast, cattle and water buffalo tend to have more chronic, subclinical infections in some regions [1]. Overall, surra can be a devastating disease, with untreated cases often resulting in high morbidity and mortality.

## Diagnostic Methods

A variety of diagnostic tests are available to detect Surra caused by Trypanosoma evansi infection. These include:

[1] Microscopic examination of blood smears: Trypanosomes can be directly observed in wet blood films or Giemsa-stained thin or thick blood smears, though this method has low sensitivity, especially in chronic or subclinical cases. Concentration techniques like hematocrit centrifugation (Woo method) or anion-exchange chromatography can improve detection. [2]

[2] PCR testing: Molecular methods like PCR can detect trypanosomal DNA and are more sensitive than microscopy, especially for low parasitemia. Various PCR assays targeting the Trypanozoon subgenus or T. evansi-specific sequences have been described. [1,2]

[3] Serology: Antibody detection tests like ELISA, IFAT, and CATT/T. evansi can be used to identify exposed animals, though cross-reactivity with other trypanosomes is a potential issue. Serology is particularly useful for herd-level surveillance and to confirm subclinical infections. [2]

[4] Animal inoculation: Injection of samples into laboratory rodents can amplify low-level parasitemia, but this method is less commonly used due to animal welfare concerns. [2]

Reliable diagnosis often requires a combination of tests, with microscopy and PCR used to confirm active infections, and serology to assess herd exposure. The choice of diagnostic approach depends on the purpose (individual animal vs. herd screening), availability of expertise and resources, and epidemiological context (e.g. presence of other trypanosome species). Continued research and validation of diagnostic tools remains important for accurate detection of Surra.

## Treatment Options

Surra, the disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma evansi, can be treated with a variety of medications. The key drugs used include:

[1] Suramin: This drug is administered intravenously at a dose of 10 mg/kg, repeated after 1 week. Suramin has both curative and some prophylactic effects against T. evansi infections in horses and camels.

[2] Diminazene aceturate: This drug is given intramuscularly or subcutaneously at a dose of 3.5-7 mg/kg. It is effective against T. vivax, T. congolense, and T. brucei infections.

[3] Quinapyramine: This drug is administered subcutaneously at 3-5 mg/kg and is curative against a range of Trypanosoma species including T. evansi, T. equiperdum, and T. simiae in horses, camels, pigs, and dogs.

[4] Isometamidium chloride: This drug has both curative and prophylactic effects when given intramuscularly at 0.25-1 mg/kg, and is effective against T. vivax and T. congolense.

In addition to medication, supportive care such as fluid therapy, blood transfusions, and treatment of secondary infections may be necessary. Strict vector control through insecticide use and elimination of breeding grounds for biting flies is also important for controlling surra outbreaks. Regular monitoring for drug resistance is crucial, as resistant strains of T. evansi have been reported.

## Preventive Measures

To prevent surra in companion animals, the following measures can be implemented:

[1] Vector control - Controlling the populations of biting insects, especially tabanids and Stomoxys flies, is crucial to limiting transmission. This can involve the use of insecticides, traps, and other methods to reduce fly numbers around animals.

[2] Animal separation - Keeping highly susceptible animals like horses and camels separated from potential reservoir hosts like cattle and buffalo can help prevent transmission. Isolating infected animals is also important.

[3] Avoiding iatrogenic transmission - Proper disinfection of needles, surgical instruments, and other equipment can prevent inadvertent spread of the parasite during veterinary procedures.

[4] Controlling movement of animals - Quarantine and testing of imported animals can help prevent introduction of surra into new areas. Movement restrictions on infected animals can also limit disease spread.

[5] No vaccination available - Since there is no vaccine against surra, prevention relies on controlling the parasite and vector populations.

[6] Targeted chemoprophylaxis - Routine trypanocidal drug treatment of susceptible animals in endemic areas may help reduce infection risk, though this approach can contribute to drug resistance.

## Differential Diagnosis

The key diseases that must be distinguished from Surra (Trypanosoma evansi infection) include:

[1] African animal trypanosomiasis (nagana) - Caused by other Trypanosoma species (T. congolense, T. vivax, T. brucei) transmitted by tsetse flies in sub-Saharan Africa. Symptoms are similar to Surra but the geographic distribution differs.

[2] Dourine - A chronic venereal disease of horses caused by T. equiperdum, which is transmitted during coitus. This disease has a more localized genital presentation compared to the systemic signs of Surra.

[3] Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) - Caused by T. cruzi and transmitted by triatomine bugs in the Americas. While the parasite and vector differ from Surra, the clinical signs may be similar in some animal species.

[4] Other diseases causing anemia, weight loss, and fever such as babesiosis, anaplasmosis, theileriosis, and haemonchosis should also be considered and ruled out through appropriate diagnostic testing.
