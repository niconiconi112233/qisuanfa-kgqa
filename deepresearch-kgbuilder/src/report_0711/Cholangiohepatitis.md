## Disease Overview

Cholangiohepatitis is an inflammatory condition affecting the liver and biliary system in cats. It is one of the most common causes of feline liver disease. There are two main types of cholangiohepatitis:

1. **Neutrophilic cholangiohepatitis**: This is caused by a bacterial infection that enters the gallbladder from the intestines. It can affect cats of any age, breed or sex, and often occurs concurrently with inflammation of the intestines and/or pancreas.

2. **Lymphocytic cholangiohepatitis**: This is an immune-mediated disease, causing infiltration of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) without an underlying infection. It tends to be more chronic and progressive than the neutrophilic form. Persian cats may have a genetic predisposition.

In tropical and subtropical regions, liver flukes can also cause cholangiohepatitis in cats that ingest infected lizards, geckos or toads. 

The most common symptoms include vomiting, weight loss, loss of appetite, jaundice, and fever. Cats often have concurrent pancreatitis and inflammatory bowel disease, a condition known as "triaditis". Diagnosis involves bloodwork, abdominal ultrasound, and potentially liver biopsy. 

Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but generally involves antibiotics, immunosuppressive medications, supportive care, and in some cases surgery. Prognosis is variable, but tends to be better if caught and treated early before significant liver damage occurs.

## Common Pathogens

Cholangiohepatitis in dogs and cats can be caused by a variety of viral, bacterial, and other infectious agents. The most common causes include:

- Bacterial infections: Cholangiohepatitis is often associated with bacterial infections, particularly from bacteria that normally reside in the intestines. Bacteria can gain access to the gallbladder and bile ducts, leading to inflammation and infection.[1,2] Common bacterial culprits include Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., and mixed bacterial infections.[4] 

- Viral infections: Viral hepatitis and other viral infections can also cause cholangiohepatitis. However, the specific viruses involved are not as well-characterized as the bacterial causes.[2]

- Parasitic infections: In some regions, infestation by liver flukes can lead to cholangiohepatitis in cats and dogs that ingest infected prey like lizards, geckos, or toads.[3]

- Immune-mediated causes: A form of lymphocytic cholangiohepatitis appears to be an immune-mediated disease, without an underlying infectious agent. This is more common in cats than dogs.[2,3]

- Congenital abnormalities: Developmental defects in the bile ducts, known as ductal plate malformations, can also predispose animals to chronic cholangiohepatitis.[4]

In many cases, the underlying cause of cholangiohepatitis remains unknown, especially in the early stages of disease. Thorough diagnostic investigation, including bacterial culture, is often needed to determine the specific etiology.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Cats with cholangiohepatitis often have vague and non-specific signs of illness at home. The most common reported symptoms include vomiting, weight loss, loss of appetite, jaundice/icterus (yellow tint to skin or gums), and fever [1,2]. 

Cats with neutrophilic cholangiohepatitis tend to have more acute, severe clinical signs at home, while cats with lymphocytic cholangiohepatitis may initially show no clinical signs, or slow progression of weight loss, episodic vomiting, and listlessness [1,2].

Cats with cholangiohepatitis often have concurrent inflammation in the pancreas (pancreatitis) and intestines (inflammatory bowel disease), a syndrome often called "triaditis". Clinical signs of these diseases often overlap as they can all cause loss of appetite, vomiting, and weight loss, though diarrhea and abdominal pain are more common in cats with IBD and pancreatitis [1,2].

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnostic imaging techniques are essential for evaluating hepatic disease in dogs with cholangiohepatitis. Radiography can detect abnormal liver size and irregular liver borders, as well as potential evidence of bile duct obstruction or inflammation like mineralized densities.[1] Ultrasonography is a widely used modality that can assess distension and thickening of the biliary tract, detect gallbladder abnormalities like mucoceles and cholelithiasis, and evaluate the hepatic vasculature for anomalies like portosystemic shunts.[1,2] 

Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography has shown promise in improving the detection and characterization of focal liver lesions, with malignant nodules often appearing hypoechoic compared to normal liver at peak enhancement.[2] Computed tomography with contrast can provide detailed imaging of the hepatic and portal vasculature, aiding in the diagnosis of vascular anomalies.[2] While the role of magnetic resonance imaging in canine liver disease is still evolving, it has advantages like excellent soft tissue contrast and the ability to differentiate benign from neoplastic lesions in some cases.[2,3]

Scintigraphy can be a minimally invasive screening tool to detect the presence of portosystemic shunts, as well as assess hepatobiliary function.[2] Laboratory testing is also crucial, with hematology, serum biochemistry, and bile acid testing helping to characterize the nature and severity of the hepatic disease.[1]

Ultimately, histopathologic evaluation of a liver biopsy sample remains the gold standard for definitively diagnosing the underlying cause and etiology of cholangiohepatitis, including conditions like copper-associated hepatitis.[1]

## Treatment Options

The major specific therapy for cholangiohepatitis in dogs involves the use of antibiotics. If a neutrophilic inflammatory response is present, antibiotic coverage is indicated, whether or not cultures have retrieved bacteria. Broad-spectrum antibiotics like metronidazole, fluoroquinolones, and ampicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors are commonly used initially before culture results are available. The duration of antibiotic treatment can range from 2-4 weeks to several months, depending on the underlying cause and response to treatment.

In cases of cholangiohepatitis secondary to extrahepatic bile duct obstruction, surgical intervention may be required to relieve the obstruction or remove the gallbladder. This is important to allow proper bile flow and prevent further inflammation.

Additional supportive care can include:

- Choleretics like ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol) to improve bile flow
- Antioxidants like S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and vitamin E to support liver health
- Corticosteroids in cases of immune-mediated cholangiohepatitis
- Fluid therapy, anti-nausea medications, and pain relief as needed for severely ill patients

Regular monitoring of liver values and clinical signs is important to assess response to treatment. Cats with cholangiohepatitis may require lifelong low-dose immunosuppressive medication to prevent recurrence. The prognosis depends on the underlying cause and severity, but with prompt and appropriate treatment, many dogs can make a full recovery. [1,2,3,4]

## Preventive Measures

Examination of vaccination protocols and environmental management strategies to prevent cholangiohepatitis.

To prevent cholangiohepatitis, vaccination protocols and environmental management strategies should be considered. Vaccination against infectious canine hepatitis caused by canine adenovirus type I is an important preventive measure, as this disease can contribute to the development of cholangiohepatitis [1]. Extensive vaccination protocols using cross-reacting canine adenovirus vaccines have helped make infectious canine hepatitis quite rare.

In addition to vaccination, managing factors that can predispose dogs to cholangiohepatitis is crucial. Conditions that interrupt the normal flow of bile, such as gallbladder stones (choleliths) and thickened bile material (gallbladder mucocele), can increase the risk of cholangiohepatitis [2]. Addressing any underlying gallbladder or biliary tract issues through dietary management, medications, or surgical intervention can help prevent cholangiohepatitis.

Environmental factors, such as a dog's diet and exposure to potential sources of bacterial infection, should also be considered. Feeding a raw meat diet or allowing a dog to scavenge carcasses or garbage can increase the risk of bacterial translocation and cholangiohepatitis [3]. Maintaining good gastrointestinal health and preventing enteric infections are important preventive measures.

In summary, a comprehensive approach to preventing cholangiohepatitis includes:

1. Vaccination against infectious canine hepatitis [1]
2. Management of gallbladder and biliary tract conditions that impair bile flow [2] 
3. Dietary and environmental control to prevent bacterial translocation [3]

## Differential Diagnosis

Cholangiohepatitis, an inflammatory condition affecting the liver and biliary system, can have similar clinical signs to other diseases. It is important to distinguish cholangiohepatitis from other conditions to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

One key distinction is the concurrent inflammation that often occurs in the pancreas (pancreatitis) and intestines (inflammatory bowel disease) in cats with cholangiohepatitis, known as "triaditis" [1]. This can lead to overlapping symptoms such as vomiting, weight loss, and lack of appetite. However, diarrhea and abdominal pain are more common in cats with inflammatory bowel disease and pancreatitis [1].

Cats with the lymphocytic form of cholangiohepatitis may initially show no clinical signs or only slow progression of symptoms like weight loss, episodic vomiting, and lethargy [2]. In contrast, cats with the more acute neutrophilic form tend to have more severe clinical signs such as fever, dehydration, and jaundice [2].

Hepatic lipidosis, a form of liver disease, can also occur concurrently with cholangiohepatitis and confuse initial assessments [2]. Differentiating between these conditions may require advanced imaging and laboratory testing, including liver biopsy.

Ultimately, a comprehensive evaluation incorporating blood work, ultrasound findings, and potentially liver biopsy is necessary to distinguish cholangiohepatitis from other hepatic and gastrointestinal disorders in cats. [1,2]
