## Disease Overview

Lymphocytosis is a condition characterized by an abnormal increase in the number of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, in the peripheral blood. This condition can occur in both dogs and cats, and can have various underlying causes. [1] Canine lymphocytosis has been associated with lymphoproliferative disorders, where there is an uncontrolled proliferation of lymphocytes. [1] In cats, lymphocytosis has been linked to various immunophenotypic changes and clinical outcomes. [2] 

Lymphocytosis can occur as a result of both benign and malignant conditions. Some common causes include infection, inflammation, and certain endocrine disorders. [5] In dogs, a CD8+ lymphocytosis of over 30,000 lymphocytes/μL has been associated with a significantly shorter median survival time compared to those with lower lymphocyte counts. [4] Approximately 25% of canine companions and 20% of feline companions will develop naturally-occurring cancer in their lifetime, which may contribute to the development of lymphocytosis in some cases.

## Common Pathogens

Lymphocytosis, or an abnormally high number of lymphocytes in the blood, can have various causes in pets. Viral infections, such as feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or canine distemper virus, can lead to lymphocytosis as the immune system responds to the infection.[1] Bacterial infections, including Ehrlichia species in dogs and Mycoplasma haemofelis in cats, can also trigger an increase in lymphocytes.[2] 

Additionally, non-infectious conditions like hyperthyroidism in cats or hypoadrenocorticism (Addison's disease) in dogs can result in lymphocytosis.[1] Age-related factors, such as the increased lymphocyte counts often seen in young animals under 6 months, may also contribute to this blood abnormality.[2] In some cases, lymphocytosis can even be a sign of certain types of cancer, like chronic lymphocytic leukemia in cats.[3,4]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Lymphocytosis, or an abnormal increase in the number of lymphocytes in the blood, can present with a wide range of clinical symptoms and signs in dogs and cats. [1] Some common manifestations include:

Nonspecific symptoms such as lethargy, anorexia, and weight loss may occur, particularly in cases of underlying immune-mediated disease or lymphoma. [2] Physical examination may reveal peripheral lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly in some patients. [3] 

In many cases, however, lymphocytosis is an incidental finding on routine bloodwork, with the patient otherwise appearing clinically healthy. [2] This can be due to physiologic lymphocytosis in young animals or reactive lymphocytosis from antigenic stimulation. [3]

Definitive diagnosis requires a thorough history, physical exam, and further diagnostics such as cytology or biopsy to determine the underlying cause of the lymphocytosis. [1] Management depends on the specific etiology, ranging from supportive care to immunosuppressive therapy.

## Diagnostic Methods

To diagnose lymphocytosis in pets, veterinarians typically perform a complete blood count (CBC) to measure the number of lymphocytes present in the patient's blood. For dogs, a lymphocyte count above 5,000 cells/μL is considered above the reference range and may indicate lymphocytosis [1]. In feline cases, flow cytometry of peripheral blood can sometimes provide additional prognostic information [2].

In some instances, a blood smear review may be warranted to assess lymphocyte morphology and concentration changes [3]. Cutaneous lymphocytosis, a rare lymphoproliferative disorder, can also be diagnosed through skin biopsies and histopathological examination [4]. Veterinarians may also consider other diagnostic tests, such as PARR (polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor rearrangement), to further characterize the underlying cause of lymphocytosis [2].

## Treatment Options

The management of lymphocytosis in pets primarily involves addressing the underlying cause. In adult dogs, the most common reason for isolated lymphocytosis is a lymphoproliferative disorder such as lymphoma or leukemia [1]. In these cases, the treatment may involve chemotherapy, targeted therapies, or other immunomodulatory approaches.

For cats, an increase in CD4+ T-cell lymphocytosis can be treated with medications like chlorambucil, which may be more effective than multi-drug protocols [2]. Additionally, lymphocytosis can be a normal finding in young horses and cats, and may not require specific treatment [3].

Regardless of the cause, supportive care and nursing approaches are essential in managing pets with lymphocytosis. This may include monitoring the pet's overall health, providing a nutritious diet, and ensuring a stress-free environment [4]. Regular veterinary check-ups and blood work are also crucial for tracking the progression of the condition and adjusting the treatment plan as needed [5].

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination strategies and environmental management are crucial in preventing lymphocytosis in pets. Modified live vaccines are commonly used, as they can replicate in the lymph nodes and mimic natural infection [2]. However, these vaccines may lead to temporary fever and general malaise [2]. The WSAVA guidelines recommend core vaccines be given no more frequently than every three years after the 12-month booster injection following the puppy/kitten series [5]. This helps prevent over-vaccination and potential adverse effects.

In addition to vaccination, maintaining a clean and healthy environment for pets can help reduce the risk of lymphocytosis. Studies have shown that certain immunotherapeutic strategies, such as the LBSapSal vaccine, can increase circulating T-lymphocyte subsets (CD4+ and CD8+) and reduce parasitism in dogs [4]. These types of preventive measures may be beneficial in managing lymphocytosis in pet populations.

## Differential Diagnosis

Lymphocytosis, an abnormally high number of lymphocytes in the blood, can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions. The key differential diagnoses to consider include:

Antigenic stimulation: This can occur due to chronic infections, autoimmune disorders, or certain medications.[1] Endocrine diseases such as hypothyroidism or Addison's disease can also lead to lymphocytosis.[1,2]

Lymphoid neoplasia: Persistent lymphocytosis may be a sign of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoma.[1,5] These lymphoid malignancies result in the uncontrolled proliferation of lymphocytes.

Less common causes include thymoma, a tumor of the thymus gland, and chronic infections like ehrlichiosis.[2] Mild lymphocytosis can also be seen in hyperthyroidism in cats.[4]

Careful evaluation of the patient's history, clinical signs, and laboratory findings is essential to determine the underlying cause of the lymphocytosis and guide appropriate treatment.

This report synthesizes authoritative sources to provide a comprehensive overview of this condition, including its common pathogenic triggers, typical clinical presentation, diagnostic approaches, and management strategies. Key findings highlight the importance of prompt identification and targeted treatment to ensure the best outcomes for affected pets.

## Summary

Lymphocytosis can stem from viral infections, bacterial diseases, endocrine disorders, and even certain cancers. Clinical signs range from nonspecific symptoms like lethargy and weight loss to more specific manifestations like lymphadenopathy. Veterinarians utilize complete blood counts, blood smears, and advanced diagnostics to pinpoint the root cause. Treatments focus on addressing the underlying condition, with supportive care playing a crucial role. Preventive measures, such as judicious vaccination and environmental management, can help mitigate the risk of lymphocytosis in companion animals.
