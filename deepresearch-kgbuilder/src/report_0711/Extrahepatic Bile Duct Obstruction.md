## Disease Overview

Extrahepatic bile duct obstruction (EHBDO) is a common problem in dogs and cats, caused by a blockage in the normal flow of bile from the liver to the intestinal tract. The most frequent causes are inflammation (e.g. pancreatitis, duodenitis) [1,2], neoplasia, cholelithiasis, gallbladder mucoceles, choledochitis/cholecystitis, bile duct malformations, parasitic infection, extrinsic compression, fibrosis, and bile duct strictures [3].

Acute complete EHBDO leads to rapid development of jaundice, lethargy, cyclic fever, and vomiting [3,4]. With chronic obstruction, hepatomegaly, acholic feces, bleeding tendencies, and vitamin K deficiency can occur [3,4]. Diagnostic confirmation involves imaging (ultrasonography, laparotomy) and monitoring of liver enzymes and serum bilirubin [3]. 

Successful treatment requires biliary decompression, often through surgical intervention to remove obstructions and allow proper bile drainage [3]. However, the risks are high, especially in cats, and persistent obstruction can lead to biliary cirrhosis and acquired portosystemic shunts [3].

## Common Pathogens

The main causes of extrahepatic bile duct obstruction (EHBO) include:

[1] Pancreatic disease, such as pancreatitis.[1,2] Pancreatitis can lead to inflammation and swelling that obstructs the bile duct.

[2] Stone formation within the biliary system, known as cholelithiasis or gallstones.[1,3,5] These stones can block the bile duct and prevent bile flow.

[3] Cancer affecting the pancreas, bile duct, or intestine.[1,2,5] Tumors in these areas can physically obstruct the bile duct.

[4] Inflammatory conditions like cholangiohepatitis, cholecystitis, and cholelithiasis.[2,5] Inflammation and swelling in the biliary tract can obstruct bile flow.

[5] Liver flukes (Platynosomum concinnum) can also cause EHBO in cats.[3]

In summary, the main causative agents leading to extrahepatic bile duct obstruction are pancreatitis, gallstones, cancer, and various inflammatory conditions affecting the biliary system and surrounding organs. Parasitic infections like liver flukes can also be a cause in cats.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Dogs and cats with extrahepatic bile duct obstruction often present with nonspecific clinical signs that mimic other abdominal disorders. The most frequently reported signs include [1]:

- Decreased appetite
- Vomiting 
- Diarrhea
- Lethargy
- Icterus (jaundice)

Many animals are not examined until clinical signs of icterus develop, which indicates a complete obstruction of the biliary tract [1]. Other signs that may be present include [1,2]:

- Acholic (pale) feces
- Absence of urine urobilinogen (inconsistent)
- Bleeding tendencies (more common in cats)
- GI ulceration at the pyloric-duodenal junction leading to blood loss

Laboratory findings that support the diagnosis include [1,2]:

- Nonregenerative anemia with chronic obstruction
- Regenerative anemia with enteric bleeding
- Neutrophilic leukocytosis 
- Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT)
- Hypercholesterolemia
- Vitamin K deficiency leading to coagulopathy

Abdominal imaging, particularly ultrasound, is critical for confirming the presence and location of the biliary obstruction [1,2]. Dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are common findings.

## Diagnostic Methods

Extrahepatic bile duct obstruction often presents with nonspecific clinical signs such as decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, and jaundice. [1] Laboratory tests typically show an increase in serum alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and bilirubin levels. [1,3] 

Ultrasonography is a sensitive diagnostic tool for identifying the cause and location of the obstruction. [1,3] Dilated bile ducts, distended gallbladder, and the presence of stones or other mass lesions can often be visualized on ultrasound. [1,3] 

In some cases, exploratory laparotomy may be required to definitively diagnose the cause of the obstruction and allow for surgical correction. [1] Radiographs can also help identify radiopaque gallstones or other structural abnormalities. [1]

Overall, a combination of clinical signs, laboratory testing, and imaging modalities are used to diagnose extrahepatic bile duct obstruction in small animals. [1,3]

## Treatment Options

Extrahepatic bile duct obstruction is a serious condition that requires prompt intervention. The primary treatment approach is surgical decompression of the biliary system. This may involve removal of obstructing lesions, such as gallstones or tumors, or creation of a bypass to allow bile drainage, such as a cholecystoenterostomy or choledochoduodenostomy.[1] 

In some cases, particularly those secondary to pancreatitis, the obstruction may resolve spontaneously as the underlying inflammation subsides. In these situations, temporary biliary drainage via methods like percutaneous cholecystostomy or bile duct stenting may be used to stabilize the patient prior to definitive surgery.[2,3] This can help normalize systemic abnormalities like coagulopathy and electrolyte imbalances before subjecting the patient to the stress of a major surgical procedure.

Supportive care is critical, and may include fluid therapy, nutritional support, antibiotics, and management of complications like gastrointestinal bleeding. Vitamin K supplementation is often needed to correct coagulation deficits.[4] Overall, a multimodal approach combining surgical, medical, and nursing interventions is typically required to successfully manage extrahepatic bile duct obstruction.

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination protocols or environmental/management strategies to help prevent extrahepatic bile duct obstruction are not well-established. The underlying causes of extrahepatic bile duct obstruction, such as pancreatitis, cholelithiasis, and neoplasia, would need to be addressed through appropriate prevention and management. 

Some general preventive measures that may help include:

1. [1] Controlling pancreatitis through dietary management, avoidance of dietary indiscretions, and prompt treatment of any episodes. Pancreatitis is a common cause of bile duct obstruction.

2. [2] Monitoring for and managing cholelithiasis (gallstones) through dietary modifications and medications if detected early. Cholelithiasis can lead to bile duct obstruction.

3. [3,4] Screening for and early detection of any neoplastic processes affecting the biliary tract or surrounding organs. Prompt treatment of any tumors may help prevent obstruction.

4. [1] Minimizing any potential trauma or insults to the biliary tract that could lead to inflammation, scarring, and eventual obstruction.

However, there are no specific vaccination protocols or comprehensive environmental/management strategies that have been shown to reliably prevent extrahepatic bile duct obstruction in dogs and cats. The focus should be on identifying and addressing the underlying causes through good veterinary care.

## Differential Diagnosis

Extrahepatic bile duct obstruction can have many potential causes, and it is important to consider other diseases with similar clinical signs in the differential diagnosis. Some key differential diagnoses to consider include:

[1] Pancreatitis - Pancreatitis is a common cause of extrahepatic bile duct obstruction, as swelling in the pancreas can compress the bile duct and block bile flow. Pancreatitis often presents with vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice, similar to bile duct obstruction. [1]

[2] Cholelithiasis (gallstones) - Gallstones can obstruct the bile duct and lead to extrahepatic bile duct obstruction. Gallstones are a relatively common cause of bile duct obstruction in dogs and cats. [1,2] 

[3] Neoplasia - Cancer or tumors involving the pancreas, bile duct, or nearby organs can physically obstruct the bile duct. This includes pancreatic cancer, bile duct cancer, and intestinal tumors. [1,3]

[4] Inflammation/infection - Conditions that cause inflammation or infection in the bile duct or surrounding tissues, such as cholangitis or duodenitis, can lead to bile duct obstruction. [1,3]

[5] Bile duct malformations - Congenital abnormalities or structural defects in the bile ducts can also cause obstruction in some cases. [1]

In summary, while extrahepatic bile duct obstruction is the primary concern, the underlying cause could be pancreatitis, gallstones, neoplasia, inflammation, or a bile duct malformation. Thorough diagnostic testing is needed to determine the specific etiology in each case.
