## Disease Overview

Hyperadrenocorticism, also known as Cushing's disease, is a common endocrine disorder in companion animals, particularly in middle-aged to older dogs. [1] This condition is characterized by excessive production of cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands. [2] In dogs, the incidence of new cases is estimated to be 1 to 2 per 1,000 dogs per year, with a prevalence of pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) around 0.2%. [3] 

Cushing's disease occurs predominantly in older dogs, typically between 7 to 12 years of age. [4] The condition is less common in cats, with only about 20-25% of feline cases being adrenocortical tumors that secrete excessive cortisol. [5,6] Unlike dogs, cats with hyperadrenocorticism often present with adrenal sex steroid-producing tumors, which have a higher prevalence in cats compared to dogs. [7,8]

The clinical signs of Cushing's disease in both dogs and cats include increased thirst, increased urination, increased appetite, weight loss, muscle wasting, a pot-bellied appearance, thin skin, and hair loss. [9,10,11,12,13,14] Diagnosis typically involves a combination of clinical signs, laboratory tests, and imaging studies to confirm the underlying cause. [15]

## Common Pathogens

Hyperadrenocorticism, also known as Cushing's disease or syndrome, is a hormonal disorder in dogs and cats caused by an excess production of the hormone cortisol. The primary causes of hyperadrenocorticism are not infectious pathogens, but rather endocrine system abnormalities. [1]

In the majority of cases, hyperadrenocorticism is caused by a tumor in the pituitary gland that secretes excessive amounts of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This ACTH oversignaling leads to bilateral hyperplasia of the adrenal glands and overproduction of cortisol. [2,3] Alternatively, in a smaller percentage of cases, hyperadrenocorticism can be caused by a tumor directly in one of the adrenal glands. [6,10]

Hyperadrenocorticism is not contagious and does not have any known infectious causes in dogs or cats. It is considered an endocrine disorder, not a disease caused by viruses, bacteria, or other pathogens. [4,9] The excessive cortisol production disrupts normal physiological processes, leading to the characteristic clinical signs of the condition.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Hyperadrenocorticism, also known as Cushing's disease, is a condition in pets characterized by excessive production of the hormone cortisol. The most common clinical signs include increased thirst and urination, increased appetite, weight gain, muscle weakness, lethargy, and thinning of the skin [1]. Affected pets may also exhibit excessive panting, pot-bellied appearance, and a dull, rough hair coat [2,3]. In some cases, dogs may experience alopecia (hair loss) and fragile skin that bruises easily [3,4]. The increased appetite is a direct result of the excess cortisol, which stimulates the appetite and causes the body to store more fat [5]. Overall, the clinical presentation of hyperadrenocorticism can vary, but these symptoms are typically the most prominent.

## Diagnostic Methods

The diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism, also known as Cushing's disease, typically involves a combination of clinical presentation and laboratory testing. The clinical signs of this endocrine disorder often include polyuria (increased urination), polydipsia (increased thirst), polyphagia (increased appetite), panting, abdominal distention, muscle weakness, and dermatologic changes like alopecia (hair loss) [1].

Screening and diagnostic tests are used to confirm the diagnosis. These may include the urine cortisol-to-creatinine ratio, low-dose dexamethasone suppression test, and ACTH stimulation test [2]. The urine cortisol-to-creatinine ratio can be used as an initial screening test, while the other two tests help differentiate between pituitary-dependent and adrenal-dependent hyperadrenocorticism [2,3]. 

In some cases, imaging techniques such as abdominal ultrasound or advanced imaging like CT or MRI may be used to further characterize the underlying cause and help guide treatment [4,5].

## Treatment Options

The primary treatment for hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing's disease) in dogs is medical management with mitotane (op'-DDD; Lysodren) [1]. Mitotane selectively destroys the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex, effectively reducing cortisol production [1]. 

Trilostane is also a commonly used medication for treating hyperadrenocorticism in both dogs and cats [7,9,10]. Trilostane inhibits the steroidogenic enzymes responsible for cortisol synthesis, thereby reducing cortisol levels [10]. The recommended dosing for cats is typically around 1 mg/kg given two to three times daily [7].

In addition to medication, supportive care and nursing management are important [2]. This may include managing clinical signs such as polyuria/polydipsia, alopecia, and muscle weakness [3]. Melatonin has also been used as a first-line treatment, especially for cases with alopecia, as it has few side effects [5].

For iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism caused by exogenous corticosteroid administration, the treatment involves a gradual, controlled withdrawal of the offending drug [6].

## Preventive Measures

While there are no proven prevention strategies for hyperadrenocorticism (HAC) in dogs, early detection and proper management of the condition can help mitigate its effects. Regular veterinary check-ups and screening tests are crucial, as they can aid in the early diagnosis of HAC before clinical signs become severe [1].

For dogs with HAC, medication such as trilostane (Vetoryl®) or mitotane (Lysodren®) is the primary treatment approach [1]. These drugs work by inhibiting the excessive production of cortisol, the hormone responsible for the clinical signs of HAC [2]. In some cases, surgical removal of the adrenal tumor may be recommended, particularly for dogs with adrenal-dependent HAC [4].

Environmental management, such as providing a calm, stress-free living environment, can also help support the overall health and well-being of dogs with HAC [3]. Additionally, owners should work closely with their veterinarians to develop a comprehensive management plan tailored to their pet's specific needs.

## Differential Diagnosis

When considering a diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing's disease) in dogs, it is important to also consider other diseases with similar symptoms. Some key conditions that should be part of the differential diagnosis include [1]:

Secondary hypothyroidism, which can occur due to the suppressive effects of excessive cortisol on the pituitary gland and thyroid function [2]. This can result in decreased levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).

Other causes of polyuria and polydipsia, such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or psychogenic polydipsia [3]. These conditions can present with clinical signs overlapping with hyperadrenocorticism.

Additionally, skin conditions like demodicosis, dermatophytosis, or allergic skin disease can cause similar changes in the skin and coat as seen in Cushing's disease [4].

A thorough clinical assessment, laboratory testing, and diagnostic imaging are typically required to differentiate hyperadrenocorticism from these other potential causes of the presenting signs [5].

# Pet Disease: Hyperadrenocorticism

Hyperadrenocorticism, also known as Cushing's disease, is a common endocrine disorder in companion animals, particularly middle-aged to older dogs. This condition is characterized by excessive production of the hormone cortisol, leading to a range of clinical signs including increased thirst, urination, appetite, and weight gain. The diagnosis involves a combination of laboratory tests, imaging, and clinical presentation. Treatment typically focuses on medications that inhibit cortisol production, along with supportive care to manage the associated symptoms. While prevention strategies are limited, early detection and proper management can help mitigate the effects of this complex condition.

## Summary

Hyperadrenocorticism is primarily caused by pituitary or adrenal gland abnormalities, rather than infectious agents. Key diagnostic tests include the urine cortisol-to-creatinine ratio, low-dose dexamethasone suppression test, and ACTH stimulation test. Treatment options center around medications like mitotane and trilostane, which reduce cortisol levels, along with supportive care. Preventive measures focus on early detection and management, as there are no proven strategies to avoid the development of this endocrine disorder. Differentiating hyperadrenocorticism from similar conditions, such as hypothyroidism and diabetes, is critical for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
