## Disease Overview

Thrombocytosis is a condition characterized by an abnormally high number of platelets in the blood, which can occur in both dogs and cats. [1] In a study of 158 cats with thrombocytosis, the condition was more commonly associated with gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, or immune-mediated diseases compared to a control group. [1,3] Similarly, a study of 715 dogs found an incidence of thrombocytosis of 7.2%, with a mean age of affected dogs being 9.16 ± 3.56 years. [2] The sex distribution was 48.1% spayed females. [2] While the epidemiology of thrombocytosis in companion animals is not fully understood, these studies provide important insights into the prevalence and associations of this condition in dogs and cats.

## Common Pathogens

Thrombocytosis, an abnormally high platelet count, can have a variety of underlying causes in pets. [1] The most common causes are not infectious but rather a physiological response to other conditions or stimuli.

Reactive thrombocytosis is often triggered by the release of epinephrine (adrenaline) due to factors like exercise, excitement, or certain medications. [2] It can also be a secondary response to underlying diseases in other parts of the body. [3] These diseases may include infections, inflammatory conditions, or cancers that stimulate increased platelet production. [4]

In rare cases, thrombocytosis may be caused by a primary bone marrow disorder, such as a myeloproliferative neoplasm. [3] However, this is an uncommon cause compared to the more typical reactive thrombocytosis. [5]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Thrombocytosis, an abnormally high platelet count, can present with a variety of clinical symptoms in pets. In dogs, common symptoms may include blood in the stool, a distended abdomen, an enlarged spleen, chronic anemia, and weight loss [1]. In cats, gastrointestinal issues are often associated with thrombocytosis, including vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, polyphagia, dyschezia, and intestinal foreign bodies [2,3]. Other potential signs in cats include jaundice and regurgitation [2].

Thrombocytosis is more commonly linked to gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, or immune-mediated diseases in cats compared to the general feline population [3]. While thrombocytosis can be caused by a myeloproliferative disorder, it is more often a nonspecific response to an underlying condition [4]. If clinical signs are present, an enlarged spleen, distended abdomen, or blood in the stool may be observed [5].

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosing thrombocytosis in companion animals typically involves a combination of clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory testing. [1] The main differential diagnosis is essential thrombocythemia (ET), a clonal disorder of hematopoiesis. [1] 

To confirm thrombocytosis, a complete blood count (CBC) is performed to measure platelet levels. [2] Elevated platelet counts (thrombocytosis) above the reference range are a key diagnostic finding. [2] Additional tests may include a peripheral blood smear to assess platelet morphology and rule out platelet clumping. [3]

Identifying the underlying cause of thrombocytosis is essential for proper treatment. [3] Diagnostic tests may include biochemistry panels, urinalysis, and imaging to assess for potential contributing conditions such as neoplasia, inflammation, or metabolic disorders. [3,4] In some cases, a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy may be recommended to distinguish reactive thrombocytosis from ET. [1]

## Treatment Options

The management of thrombocytosis in pets involves a multi-pronged approach, including medication, supportive care, and nursing interventions. [1] For cases where thrombocytosis is a response to an underlying condition, the primary treatment should focus on addressing the underlying cause. [3] This may involve medications to control the root disorder, such as anti-inflammatory drugs or immunosuppressants. [5]

In the meantime, anticoagulant medications like aspirin can be prescribed to help decrease platelet clotting and reduce the risk of thromboembolism. [4] Supportive care, such as monitoring platelet counts and providing a calm, stress-free environment, is also important. [3] Nursing interventions may include administering fluids, providing supplemental oxygen, and closely observing the pet for any signs of bleeding or other complications. [2]

## Preventive Measures

To prevent thrombocytosis in pets, it is important to focus on vaccination strategies and environmental management techniques. Routine veterinary examinations are recommended annually, even if vaccines are not administered that year, to ensure optimal protection [2]. Comprehensive vaccination guidelines are available for both canine and feline patients, outlining appropriate schedules and protocols [3].

However, it is crucial to be mindful that some viral infections and certain vaccines, such as modified-live viruses (especially canine distemper virus), can lead to temporary thrombocytopenia, a decrease in platelet count, within 7-10 days of administration [4]. While modern vaccines are considered very safe for pets, there is always a potential for reactions in some individuals [5]. Therefore, close monitoring of the animal's health and platelet levels is advised following vaccination.

## Differential Diagnosis

Thrombocytosis, an elevated platelet count, can be caused by various underlying conditions. While a high platelet count is commonly associated with myeloproliferative disorders, it is often a nonspecific response to other underlying diseases.[1] 

Some key differential diagnoses to consider include:

- Neoplasia: Neoplastic processes, such as certain types of cancer, are a common cause of thrombocytosis in both dogs and cats.[2,3] The type of cancer can influence the degree of thrombocytosis.

- Inflammatory diseases: Inflammatory conditions, like infections or immune-mediated disorders, can also lead to an elevated platelet count, particularly in cats.[3] 

- Gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary diseases: In cats, thrombocytosis is more commonly associated with gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary disorders compared to the general cat population.[3]

- Drug-induced response: Certain medications, such as vincristine or epinephrine, can trigger a temporary increase in platelet numbers.[1]

Differentiating the underlying cause of thrombocytosis requires a thorough clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and potentially imaging or other diagnostic procedures. Identifying the root cause is crucial for proper management and treatment of the condition.

Thrombocytosis, an abnormally high platelet count, is a condition that can affect both dogs and cats. While the underlying causes are not fully understood, studies have linked thrombocytosis to a variety of underlying health issues, including gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and immune-mediated disorders. By examining the epidemiology, common pathogens, clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods, treatment options, and preventive measures, this report provides a comprehensive overview of this pet health concern.

## Conclusion

The management of thrombocytosis in pets requires a multifaceted approach, focusing on addressing the underlying cause while providing supportive care and monitoring. Key takeaways from this report include:

* Thrombocytosis is more commonly associated with gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and immune-mediated diseases in cats compared to the general feline population.
* Diagnostic testing, including complete blood counts and peripheral blood smears, is crucial for confirming thrombocytosis and identifying the root cause.
