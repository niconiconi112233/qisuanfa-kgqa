## Disease Overview

Cytauxzoonosis is a life-threatening infectious disease of domestic cats caused by a protozoan parasite, Cytauxzoon felis [1]. It is an emerging tick-borne disease that affects both domestic and wild felids in North America [3]. The disease can cause acute or chronic illness in cats, and is associated with a high mortality rate despite available treatment options [2]. 

The prevalence of infection in domestic cats is not well-documented, as most cats often die soon after contracting the disease [4]. Transmission occurs through the bite of infected ticks, with the parasite undergoing a complex life cycle in both the tick vector and the feline host [5]. Understanding the epidemiology and disease progression of Cytauxzoonosis is crucial for developing effective prevention and management strategies for this emerging threat to domestic cat health.

## Common Pathogens

Cytauxzoonosis is a tick-borne parasitic disease caused by the protozoan organism Cytauxzoon felis.[1] This parasite infects the blood cells of cats, leading to a severe and potentially fatal illness.[1] The ticks that typically transmit the disease are the American Dog Tick (Dermacentor variabilis) and the Lone Star Tick.[3] 

The clinical disease in cats is thought to be primarily attributed to large schizonts (a stage in the parasite's life cycle) within macrophages, which are a type of immune cell.[4] This rapid proliferation of the parasite in the host's cells leads to the severe and rapidly progressive nature of cytauxzoonosis.[5]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Pets with Cytauxzoonosis, a serious tick-borne disease, typically exhibit a range of clinical symptoms and signs. The most common presenting complaints are anorexia (loss of appetite) and lethargy.[1] Fever is another hallmark symptom, with temperatures often reaching up to 106°F (41.1°C).[1,2] 

Other common signs include vomiting, diarrhea, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes).[2,3] The initial symptoms are often vague and non-specific, making early diagnosis challenging.[3] Clinical signs usually develop around 10 days after the initial tick bite that transmitted the disease.[3,4]

As the disease progresses, the cat's condition can quickly deteriorate, leading to severe illness and potentially death if left untreated.[2,4] Prompt veterinary care is crucial for managing Cytauxzoonosis in pets.

## Diagnostic Methods

Cytauxzoonosis, a life-threatening disease in cats caused by the protozoan parasite Cytauxzoon felis, can be diagnosed through a combination of clinical presentation and laboratory testing. [1] The most consistent clinical sign is an acute onset of lethargy, anorexia, fever, and icterus (yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes). [2,3,4] Some cats may present in a moribund (near-death) state. [1]

Laboratory diagnosis typically involves a complete blood count (CBC) and blood smear examination. [6] The CBC may reveal anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. [3,4] Microscopic examination of blood smears can identify the parasitic piroplasms or the larger, schizont-laden macrophages. [7,9] Fine needle aspirates of the liver, spleen, or lymph nodes may also be used to identify the parasite. [7]

In some cases, molecular diagnostic techniques such as PCR may be used to confirm the presence of Cytauxzoon DNA. [8] However, these tests are not always readily available in all veterinary settings.

## Treatment Options

The current treatment of choice for cytauxzoonosis in cats is a combination of the antimalarial drug atovaquone (15 mg/kg PO q8h) and the antibiotic azithromycin (10 mg/kg PO q24h) for 10 days.[1] This combination therapy has been shown to improve survival rates, with up to 60% of treated cats surviving.[8]

In addition to the antidisease medications, supportive care is crucial for managing cytauxzoonosis. This includes intravenous fluid therapy, blood transfusions if necessary, and anti-thrombotic therapies such as unfractionated heparin.[2,6] Oxygen therapy may also be required in severe cases.[6] Intensive monitoring and nursing care are essential for these critically ill cats.[7]

Some veterinary protocols also recommend combining the atovaquone-azithromycin therapy with the antibiotic enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg PO or SC q12h for 10 days).[4] However, the efficacy of this triple-drug approach has not been as extensively studied.

## Preventive Measures

The most effective way to prevent cytauxzoonosis in cats is to reduce tick exposure. Routine use of veterinarian-recommended tick prevention products is crucial, as this helps keep ticks from feeding on cats [1]. Additionally, keeping cats indoors as much as possible can significantly reduce the risk of tick encounters [2,4]. 

In areas with high tick prevalence, environmental management strategies such as clearing brush and tall grass around the home can help make the outdoor areas less hospitable for ticks [3]. Frequent tick checks and prompt removal of any attached ticks are also important preventive measures [4].

While there is no vaccine currently available for cytauxzoonosis, ongoing research is exploring potential vaccine development [5]. Consulting with a veterinarian to stay up-to-date on the latest preventive recommendations is advised for cat owners in areas where this disease is a concern.

## Differential Diagnosis

In endemic areas, cytauxzoonosis is a likely differential diagnosis for any acutely ill, febrile cat with outdoor exposure during the spring, summer, or fall seasons [1]. The typical hematologic abnormalities associated with cytauxzoonosis include leukopenia with toxic neutrophils, thrombocytopenia, and a normocytic, normochromic anemia [2]. Cats with clinical signs of cytauxzoonosis are also more commonly immunocompromised or have secondary infections and immune-mediated diseases [3].

Other potential differential diagnoses to consider include feline panleukopenia, feline infectious peritonitis, and other blood-borne infectious diseases [4]. Cytauxzoonosis can cause both acute and chronic illness in cats, and while treatable, it is associated with a high mortality rate [4]. Blood tests are essential for diagnosis, as they can reveal the characteristic hematologic changes [5].

# Pet Disease: Cytauxzoonosis

Cytauxzoonosis is a life-threatening, tick-borne disease that affects domestic cats in North America. Caused by the protozoan parasite Cytauxzoon felis, this emerging illness can rapidly progress to severe illness and even death if left untreated. Understanding the epidemiology, clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods, and preventive measures for cytauxzoonosis is crucial for protecting the health of cats in endemic regions.

## Conclusion

The key insights from this report on cytauxzoonosis in cats include:

* Cytauxzoon felis is the primary pathogen responsible for this tick-borne disease, with the American dog tick and lone star tick as the main vectors.
* Clinical signs such as fever, lethargy, anorexia, and jaundice are common, often developing rapidly after infection.
* Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical presentation and laboratory tests, including blood smears and PCR analysis.
* While no vaccine is currently available, preventive measures focus on tick control and environmental management to reduce exposure risk.
* Treatment with a combination of antimalarial and antibiotic drugs, along with supportive care, can improve survival odds in affected cats.

Continued research and education are needed to address this emerging threat to feline health, particularly in regions where cytauxzoonosis is endemic.
