## Disease Overview

Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a severe, immune-mediated coronaviral disease of cats caused by certain strains of feline coronavirus (FCoV) [1]. All FCoV infections have the potential to cause clinical FIP in cats, with the disease progressing in approximately 5-12% of affected cats [1]. 

FCoV exists in two forms: the low-virulence feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and the high-virulence FIP virus (FIPV) [1]. The pathogenesis of FIP involves the conversion of FCoV to the FIPV biotype, which is able to infect and replicate within monocytes and macrophages, leading to dissemination throughout the body [1]. This internal mutation hypothesis explains how a small proportion of cats persistently infected with FCoV develop the more severe FIP disease [1].

FIP is ubiquitous in most feline populations globally, with a seroprevalence of around 15% in single-cat households and up to 50-90% in high-density cat environments like shelters and catteries [1]. Transmission occurs mainly via the fecal-oral route, with kittens often contracting the virus from infected queens [1]. Several risk factors have been identified for developing FIP, including young or geriatric age, male sex, purebred status, and recent stress or illness [1,3].

Overall, FIP remains a challenging disease to diagnose definitively, especially antemortem, due to the lack of a single pathognomonic test and the overlap in clinical signs with other feline diseases [1,7]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to detect FCoV RNA has become one of the most reliable diagnostic indicators, but the choice of sample type is crucial for maximizing test sensitivity [8-11].

## Common Pathogens

The most common causative agents of peritonitis in dogs and cats include:

[1] Enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Bacteroides spp, Clostridium spp, Klebsiella spp, and Enterococcus spp. These are typically associated with secondary septic peritonitis resulting from loss of gastrointestinal integrity, such as from perforating ulcers, foreign body penetration, or surgical wound dehiscence. [1]

[2] Gram-positive bacteria are more commonly associated with primary septic peritonitis, which is less common but can result from hematogenous or lymphogenous bacterial spread, transmural bacterial migration from the GI tract, or bacterial spread from the oviducts. [1] 

[3] Feline coronavirus (FCoV) can also cause feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a viral disease that leads to peritoneal inflammation. FIP occurs in around 5-10% of FCoV-infected cats. [2,3,4]

[4] Other infectious agents that can cause primary peritonitis include Nocardia spp, Mycobacterium spp, and Haemophilus parasuis. [2]

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Peritonitis in small animals often presents with nonspecific symptoms such as weakness, rapid breathing, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, decreased defecation, and black stools [1]. The abdomen may be distended, and abdominal palpation can elicit pain [1,3]. Other signs can include fever, low blood pressure, pale gums, rapid heart rate, and the appearance of an abdominal mass [3]. 

In more severe cases, peritonitis can lead to shock, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to the absorption of toxins and fluid loss into the abdominal cavity [2]. Paralytic ileus, or functional obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, is another common complication that increases mortality [2].

## Diagnostic Methods

To diagnose peritonitis in dogs, veterinarians will first perform a physical examination to check for signs of abdominal pain, fever, low blood pressure, and other symptoms [1]. They may also order various diagnostic tests:

- Blood tests: These can assess overall organ function, white blood cell count, and levels of electrolytes and other markers of infection or inflammation [1]. 

- Abdominal X-rays: These can help identify fluid accumulation in the abdomen, blockages, or masses that may be causing peritonitis [1].

- Abdominal ultrasound: This imaging technique can confirm the presence of fluid in the abdomen and help identify the underlying cause, such as a ruptured organ [1].

- Abdominocentesis: This procedure involves using a needle to extract a sample of fluid from the abdominal cavity. The fluid can then be analyzed for inflammatory cells and bacteria, helping confirm the diagnosis of peritonitis [1].

The combination of physical exam findings and these diagnostic tests allows the veterinarian to diagnose peritonitis and determine the underlying cause, which is crucial for developing an appropriate treatment plan.

## Treatment Options

Peritonitis is a serious condition that requires prompt medical and surgical intervention. The main treatment approaches include:

[1] Aggressive fluid therapy and antimicrobial administration: Rapid volume resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids and colloids is crucial to stabilize the patient. Broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria should be started immediately while awaiting culture results. [2]

[2] Surgical intervention: Exploratory laparotomy is required to identify and correct the underlying cause of peritonitis, such as gastrointestinal perforation or ruptured abdominal organ. The peritoneal cavity is thoroughly lavaged to remove contaminants and debris. [1,2]

[3] Abdominal drainage: Depending on the extent of contamination, the abdominal incision may be left partially open to allow for ongoing drainage of peritoneal exudate. Closed suction drains can also be placed. Open abdominal drainage is preferred for diffuse peritonitis, while closed suction drains are more suitable for localized infection. [1,2]

[4] Nutritional support: Enteral nutrition via feeding tubes is important to maintain gut integrity and prevent bacterial translocation. Parenteral nutrition may be necessary if the patient cannot tolerate enteral feeding. [2]

[5] Supportive care: Pain management, anti-inflammatory medications, and treatment of systemic complications like coagulopathy and organ dysfunction are crucial elements of peritonitis management. [2]

In summary, the key aspects of peritonitis treatment involve rapid stabilization, surgical management of the underlying cause, peritoneal lavage and drainage, and comprehensive supportive care. Monitoring and adjusting therapy based on the patient's response is critical for optimizing outcomes.

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is a key preventive measure against peritonitis in pets. The vaccine for feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a form of peritonitis, is controversial due to concerns about its efficacy. Multiple studies have shown that the FIP vaccine does not reliably prevent the disease [1]. As a result, the UC Davis VMTH does not routinely recommend the FIP vaccine for household cats [2]. 

For other forms of peritonitis, such as those caused by bacterial infections, vaccination against related diseases like canine coronavirus and feline panleukopenia may provide some indirect protection [3,4]. Proper environmental management, including good hygiene and disinfection, is also important to prevent the spread of pathogens that can lead to peritonitis.

Overall, while there are no vaccines specifically targeting peritonitis, a combination of core vaccinations, good hygiene, and careful monitoring of pets' health can help reduce the risk of this serious condition. Consulting with a veterinarian to develop an individualized preventive care plan is recommended.

## Differential Diagnosis

Peritonitis can present with similar symptoms to several other diseases. Key differences to help differentiate peritonitis include:

[1] Septic peritonitis often results from rupture or perforation of the gastrointestinal tract, causing rapid spillage of intestinal contents into the abdomen. This leads to severe, sudden-onset abdominal pain, fever, and shock. In contrast, other conditions like pancreatitis or gastric dilatation-volvulus may cause abdominal pain but without the rapid systemic deterioration.

[2] Uroperitoneum from a ruptured urinary bladder or urethra can cause abdominal distension and fluid accumulation, similar to peritonitis. However, the peritoneal fluid in uroperitoneum will have a creatinine concentration higher than serum.

[3] Bile peritonitis from a ruptured gallbladder or bile duct causes abdominal pain and fluid accumulation, but the peritoneal fluid will have a bilirubin concentration higher than serum.

[4] Primary or idiopathic peritonitis, such as feline infectious peritonitis, lacks an identifiable source of infection or perforation. Diagnostic tests like abdominal fluid analysis and culture are needed to differentiate this from septic peritonitis.

[5] Chronic or recurrent cases of peritonitis, often associated with underlying disease like neoplasia or granulomatous disease, may present more subtly without the classic acute signs.

In summary, a combination of history, physical exam, and laboratory testing (abdominal fluid analysis, imaging) is necessary to accurately diagnose peritonitis and distinguish it from other abdominal conditions with similar presentations. Early recognition and treatment is crucial for managing this life-threatening condition.
