## Disease Overview

Feline upper respiratory infection (URI) is a common respiratory disease complex affecting cats, primarily impacting the nose, throat, and sinuses. It is similar to the common cold in humans but can be more serious [1,2]. The condition is most frequently caused by two viruses - feline herpesvirus type-1 (FHV-1) and feline calicivirus (FCV), which together account for approximately 90% of cases [1]. Other causative agents include bacteria such as Bordetella bronchiseptica and Chlamydophila felis [1].

URI is highly contagious and spreads easily through direct contact between cats or through contaminated objects. The infection is especially common in high-density cat populations like shelters, breeding facilities, and multi-cat households [3]. Risk factors include young age, stress, overcrowding, poor ventilation, and inadequate sanitation [3].

The typical incubation period is 2-10 days after exposure, with symptoms generally lasting 7-10 days in uncomplicated cases, though they can persist for up to 3 weeks [1]. Some cats may become chronic carriers after infection, particularly with herpesvirus, which can lead to periodic disease reactivation during times of stress throughout their lives [1,4].

## Common Pathogens

The main pathogens responsible for feline upper respiratory infection can be divided into viral and bacterial causes. The most prevalent viral pathogens worldwide are feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), also known as feline viral rhinotracheitis virus, and feline calicivirus (FCV) [1]. Together these viruses account for approximately 80-90% of feline respiratory disease cases [2].

The primary bacterial pathogens include Bordetella bronchiseptica, Chlamydia felis (formerly Chlamydia psittaci), and Mycoplasma species [1]. While bacterial infections can occur independently, they often develop as secondary infections following initial viral damage to the respiratory tract [3]. Mycoplasma is frequently detected in both healthy and sick cats, though cats with severe upper respiratory signs show significantly higher rates of infection compared to clinically normal cats [4].

Less commonly, other bacterial agents like Streptococcus canis and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus may play a role as primary pathogens, particularly in shelter situations and catteries [1]. The presence of multiple pathogens acting together is common and can lead to more severe disease [5].

Based on the source material, I'll write a comprehensive section on clinical symptoms and signs of feline upper respiratory infection.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Feline upper respiratory infection (URI) manifests through several characteristic clinical signs. The most common symptoms include sneezing, nasal discharge that ranges from clear to yellow-green in color, and ocular (eye) discharge. Cats often develop conjunctivitis, which appears as swelling of the membranes around the eyes [1,2].

Affected cats may also develop ulcers in their mouth or on their corneas. The severity of symptoms can vary significantly, with some cats showing mild signs while others experience more severe manifestations. Cats may become lethargic and lose their appetite, particularly if mouth ulcers make eating painful [1,2].

In moderate to severe cases, cats may exhibit fever, dehydration, and frequent sneezing with green or yellow nasal discharge. Some cats develop oral ulcers that can cause difficulty swallowing and drooling. In rare but serious cases, cats may experience breathing difficulties, including rapid breathing or open-mouth breathing [1,3].

The duration of symptoms typically ranges from 1-3 weeks, with kittens often experiencing more severe manifestations of the disease. It's important to note that these infections are highly contagious and spread primarily through direct cat-to-cat contact or through contact with contaminated surfaces [1].

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosing feline upper respiratory infection (URI) relies primarily on recognizing characteristic clinical signs, though additional testing may be needed in certain cases. The typical clinical presentation includes sneezing, nasal congestion, conjunctivitis, and discharge from the nose or eyes that may become purulent. Less specific signs include lethargy, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and squinting [1,2].

In shelter settings and individual cases, diagnosis is usually based on clinical signs alone, with additional diagnostics typically unnecessary. However, specific pathogen testing may be warranted if multiple cats are affected, signs are severe, or the illness is prolonged. Testing options include PCR assays to detect viral and bacterial pathogens, though positive results must be interpreted cautiously since even healthy cats can test positive due to carrier states or recent vaccination [1,3].

For complex cases, diagnostic workup may include chest or skull x-rays, blood tests, or bacterial culture of abnormal discharge. Samples can be collected via conjunctival scrapings, transtracheal wash procedures, or swabs of the eyes, nose or throat [2,4]. Because serological testing has poor predictive value due to widespread exposure and vaccination, it is not typically recommended for diagnosis [1].

Based on the source material, I'll write a comprehensive treatment options section for feline upper respiratory infection.

## Treatment Options

Treatment of feline upper respiratory infection (URI) requires a multi-faceted approach combining medications and supportive care. Antibiotics, particularly doxycycline (10 mg/kg once daily), are commonly prescribed as first-line treatment to control secondary bacterial infections [1]. For more severe cases, other antibiotics like azithromycin or amoxicillin-clavulanate may be used as second-line options.

Supportive care is crucial and includes maintaining hydration through fluid therapy, ensuring adequate nutrition, and keeping the cat's face clean of discharges [2]. Steam therapy or nebulization can help loosen secretions and increase comfort. For cats with poor appetite, appetite stimulants or feeding tubes may be necessary. Anti-inflammatory medications can help reduce fever and provide pain relief when appropriate.

For cases involving feline herpesvirus, antiviral medications like famciclovir have shown effectiveness, particularly for severe infections [3]. The dosing typically ranges from 40-90 mg/kg given every 8 hours. Topical antiviral medications such as cidofovir may be prescribed for ocular complications. Additionally, stress reduction is important as stress can trigger viral reactivation [4]. Creating a quiet, comfortable recovery environment and using pheromone diffusers can help manage stress during treatment.

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination serves as a key preventive measure against feline upper respiratory infection, though it does not provide complete protection. The core vaccines target feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) and feline calicivirus (FCV), which are available as modified-live or killed virus formulations administered either subcutaneously or intranasally [1,2]. While these vaccines don't prevent infection entirely, they help reduce disease severity and duration of clinical signs [1].

Environmental management is crucial, especially in high-density settings. This includes maintaining adequate ventilation with 16 air exchanges per hour to reduce airborne pathogens and appropriate feeding protocols - healthy cats should be fed first, followed by sick cats, using disposable bowls or those disinfected with bleach solution [3]. Physical separation between vaccinated and unvaccinated cats, as well as isolating those with respiratory symptoms, helps minimize disease transmission [3].

For multi-cat environments, limiting population density and stress is important since overcrowding can trigger viral shedding in carrier cats [1]. Regular disinfection of surfaces and proper hand hygiene between handling cats are essential as the viruses can survive in the environment - FCV for days to weeks and FHV-1 for up to 18 hours [4].

## Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating cats with upper respiratory infection symptoms, several other conditions need to be differentiated from viral URI. The most important differential diagnoses include fungal infections, nasal foreign bodies, neoplasia, inflammatory polyps, tooth root disease, and allergic rhinitis [1,2].

Fungal infections, particularly cryptococcosis and aspergillosis, can mimic URI symptoms. Cryptococcosis often presents with nasal discharge, sneezing, and facial deformity. The discharge may be unilateral or bilateral and can range from serous to mucopurulent with blood [1].

Nasopharyngeal polyps, which are inflammatory nodules originating in the middle ear, can disrupt normal secretion flow leading to symptoms similar to URI. These polyps can extend into the pharynx causing mucopurulent nasal discharge and gagging [1].

Nasal neoplasia, particularly lymphoma and squamous cell carcinoma in cats, should be considered especially in older animals with chronic symptoms. Though less common than in dogs, nasal tumors can cause similar respiratory signs [1,2].

Foreign bodies, especially plant material lodged above the soft palate, can cause symptoms resembling URI. Tooth root abscesses, while uncommon, should be considered particularly in cases of unilateral discharge with evidence of dental disease [1].
