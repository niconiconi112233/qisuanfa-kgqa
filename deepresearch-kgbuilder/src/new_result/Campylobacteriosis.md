## Disease Overview

Campylobacteriosis is a significant bacterial infection that affects both animals and humans worldwide. It is caused by Campylobacter species, which are curved to spiral-shaped gram-negative bacteria that primarily colonize the gastrointestinal tract [1]. The most common disease-causing species are C. jejuni, C. coli, C. upsaliensis, and C. helveticus [2].

Campylobacter species are commonly found in both healthy and sick animals, with prevalence rates ranging from 15% to 87% in dogs [3]. While many animals can carry the bacteria without showing symptoms, young animals under 6 months of age are most susceptible to developing clinical disease [4]. The bacteria are transmitted through the fecal-oral route, with contaminated food, water, and direct contact being primary sources of infection [5].

The disease has important zoonotic implications as it can spread from animals to humans, particularly through contact with infected pets and consumption of contaminated animal products. Dogs and cats are considered significant reservoirs for human infection, making campylobacteriosis an important public health concern [4].

## Common Pathogens

Campylobacteriosis is primarily caused by bacteria from the genus Campylobacter, with several species being implicated in animal and human infections. The most significant pathogenic species are Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. C. jejuni is particularly notable as the leading cause of bacterial diarrheal illness worldwide [1,2].

Other important pathogenic species include C. upsaliensis and C. helveticus, which are specifically associated with intestinal disease in companion animals like dogs and cats. C. fetus and C. lari have also been identified as disease-causing species. Birds, especially poultry, tend to have higher infection rates of Campylobacter species compared to other animals, with C. jejuni being particularly prevalent [2].

The bacteria are characterized as spiral-shaped, gram-negative rods that exhibit distinctive corkscrew-like motility. They require specific growth conditions, being microaerophilic (needing reduced oxygen levels) and thermophilic (preferring higher temperatures). These pathogens can survive in various environmental conditions, including feces, milk, water, and urine, especially at temperatures close to 4Â°C [2,4].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Campylobacteriosis typically presents more severe clinical signs in young animals under 6 months of age, while adult pets often remain asymptomatic. The most common clinical manifestations include watery diarrhea that may contain mucus and blood. Animals frequently experience abdominal pain and cramping, accompanied by fever. In severe acute cases, particularly in puppies and kittens, patients may show systemic signs including lethargy, inappetence, and vomiting [1,2].

The diarrhea typically lasts between 5-15 days but can become chronic in some cases. In chronic infections, animals may develop persistent loose stools and experience weight loss. Tenesmus (straining to defecate) may occur in cases with colonic involvement. The presence of inflammatory cells in the feces reflects the inflammatory nature of the infection [2,3].

In rare cases, Campylobacter can cause extraintestinal infections. These include cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation), bacteremia (bacterial infection in the blood), and abortion in pregnant animals [4]. However, intestinal symptoms remain the predominant clinical presentation in companion animals with campylobacteriosis.

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosing Campylobacteriosis requires a combination of clinical evaluation and laboratory testing. Initial diagnosis is based on clinical signs, which typically include watery to mucoid diarrhea, straining, abdominal pain, lethargy, and fever [1]. However, since many dogs can carry Campylobacter without showing symptoms, laboratory confirmation is essential.

The key diagnostic methods include microscopic examination, bacterial culture, and PCR testing. A direct fecal smear stained with Gram or Romanowsky stains may reveal characteristic S-shaped or gull-shaped organisms, though this alone is not diagnostic [1]. For definitive diagnosis, fecal samples should be cultured on selective media under microaerophilic conditions [2].

Molecular methods like PCR assays have become widely available and can provide rapid, accurate diagnosis [3]. However, interpreting positive test results requires careful consideration since healthy dogs commonly carry Campylobacter. Results must be evaluated alongside the patient's age, history, clinical signs, and exclusion of other causes of diarrhea [4].

Fecal culture and sensitivity testing may be warranted in chronic or severe cases to guide antibiotic selection, as some strains show antimicrobial resistance [1]. Samples should be collected fresh and transported promptly to the laboratory, as Campylobacter organisms are sensitive to environmental conditions [5].

## Treatment Options

Treatment of Campylobacteriosis typically involves a combination of antimicrobial therapy and supportive care. The primary antibiotics used include erythromycin, azithromycin, and fluoroquinolones like enrofloxacin, with dosing determined by a veterinarian based on the animal's condition [1]. Since many infections are mild and self-limiting, antibiotics may not always be necessary, though they can help reduce bacterial shedding and transmission risk [2].

Supportive care is essential and focuses on maintaining hydration due to fluid losses from diarrhea. This may involve adding water to food, feeding canned food, or in severe cases, providing IV fluid therapy. Small, frequent meals of highly digestible food help support recovery [2]. Probiotics may also be recommended to help restore normal gut bacterial balance [2].

It's crucial that treatment decisions be guided by veterinary expertise, considering factors like the pet's health status, age, and potential antibiotic resistance [1]. Some strains have shown resistance to commonly used antibiotics, making proper drug selection important [3]. Self-prescribing antibiotics should be avoided as it can lead to incorrect dosing and contribute to antibiotic resistance [1].

## Preventive Measures

Several key preventive measures can help reduce the risk of Campylobacteriosis in pets. Proper hygiene is essential - owners should always wash hands thoroughly after handling pets, their feces, or coming into contact with animal environments [1,2]. Food safety practices are also critical, including avoiding feeding pets raw or undercooked meat and ensuring proper storage and cooking temperatures [2].

Environmental management plays an important role in prevention. This includes regularly removing feces from yards, cleaning any soiled areas in the house, and frequently laundering pet bedding [4]. For dogs specifically, owners should discourage them from consuming raw meat, scavenging feces, or eating dead animals [4].

Veterinary clinics must maintain strict hygiene and sanitation protocols to prevent spread of infection within medical facilities [1]. When dealing with infected animals, it's important to isolate them and clean contaminated areas thoroughly. For puppies and at-risk animals, monitoring and documenting antibiotic use under veterinary supervision is recommended [3].

While there is no vaccine available, focusing on these preventive measures around hygiene, food safety, and environmental management can significantly reduce transmission risks between animals and humans.

Here's my attempt at writing the Differential Diagnosis section for Campylobacteriosis:

## Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating a pet with signs suggestive of Campylobacteriosis, veterinarians must consider several other conditions that can cause similar gastrointestinal symptoms. Primary viral infections to rule out include canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus, and bacterial infections like pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella [1]. Other infectious causes such as Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and whipworms should also be considered.

Non-infectious conditions that can mimic Campylobacteriosis include dietary indiscretion, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, inflammatory bowel disease, and lymphoma. In cats specifically, hyperthyroidism should be ruled out [2]. Systemic diseases like pancreatitis and hypoadrenocorticism can present with similar gastrointestinal signs.

Diagnostic testing is essential since Campylobacter species can be found in both healthy and diarrheic animals, making determination of their role in disease challenging [3]. The presence of characteristic clinical signs in young animals, along with the identification of large numbers of organisms on fecal testing, helps support the diagnosis. However, the results must always be interpreted in light of the patient's signalment, history, clinical signs, and exclusion of other causes.
