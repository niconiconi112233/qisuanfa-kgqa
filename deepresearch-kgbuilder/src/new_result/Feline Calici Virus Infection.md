## Disease Overview

Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a highly contagious viral pathogen that primarily affects domestic cats worldwide. It belongs to the Caliciviridae family of RNA viruses and specifically to the Vesivirus genus [1,2]. As an RNA virus, FCV exhibits significant genetic variability and plasticity due to its error-prone replication, enabling successful persistence within cat populations [2].

The virus causes a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild to severe disease. Common presentations include upper respiratory tract infections, oral ulcerations, and gingivostomatitis. In rare cases, particularly virulent strains can cause a severe systemic disease with high mortality rates [3,4]. FCV is especially prevalent in multi-cat environments like shelters and breeding colonies, where infection rates can reach 25-40% of the population [5].

FCV is transmitted through direct contact with infected cats' oral and nasal secretions, as well as through aerosol droplets. The virus demonstrates remarkable environmental stability, surviving on surfaces for up to a month under favorable conditions. While vaccination is available and recommended for all cats, the high mutation rate of the virus poses ongoing challenges for achieving complete protection [4,5].

Based on the source material, I'll write a section about the common pathogens involved in Feline Calicivirus infection.

## Common Pathogens

Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Caliciviridae family and Vesivirus genus [1]. As an RNA virus, FCV demonstrates high mutability and genetic plasticity, which enables its persistent circulation within cat populations. The virus has significant genetic and antigenic variability, with studies identifying two major genogroups, of which genogroup II is exclusively found in Japanese isolates [2,3].

FCV exhibits one of the highest evolution rates among RNA viruses, with annual nucleotide substitution rates ranging from 1.32 × 10−2 to 2.64 × 10−2 within individual hosts and from 3.84 × 10−2 to 4.56 × 10−2 across populations [3]. The virus exists as a quasispecies within hosts, showing significant genetic heterogeneity even among closely related isolates.

FCV is host-specific to the Felidae family and has no zoonotic potential, meaning it cannot infect humans. While FCV-like viruses have occasionally been isolated from dogs, their role in the epidemiology of FCV remains uncertain. In 2014, a highly virulent FCV strain called TIG-1 was isolated from a Siberian tiger, demonstrating more rapid viral growth than traditional strains [3].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Feline calicivirus (FCV) infection produces a range of clinical symptoms that vary in severity depending on the viral strain and the cat's age. The primary signs typically begin with upper respiratory symptoms including sneezing, nasal congestion, and discharge from both the eyes and nose [1][2]. Most cats develop fever and may show lethargy and loss of appetite.

A distinctive feature of FCV infection is the development of oral ulcers and inflammation, particularly on the tongue and in the mouth cavity. Some cats may experience transient lameness or joint pain, which occurs more frequently in kittens [2][3]. In severe cases, infected cats can develop pneumonia, though this is relatively rare [2].

A particularly concerning form called FCV-associated virulent systemic disease (FCV-VSD) can occur, causing more severe symptoms including high fever, facial and limb swelling, skin ulcers, and jaundice. This systemic form has a high mortality rate of up to 60% [2][3].

Most cats recover from standard FCV infection within 5-10 days with proper care, though severe cases may take up to 6 weeks to resolve. Some cats become asymptomatic carriers after recovery and can continue shedding the virus intermittently [1][2].

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosing Feline Calicivirus (FCV) involves both clinical observation and specific laboratory testing methods. Initial diagnosis begins with examining symptoms like respiratory distress, oral ulcers, and digestive issues [1]. However, since these clinical signs can resemble other feline respiratory infections, definitive diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation.

The most sensitive diagnostic method is PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing, which detects the genetic sequence of the virus through samples collected from throat swabs [1,2]. PCR testing is particularly effective because it can identify infections early and has a lower chance of false negative results compared to other methods [2].

Additional diagnostic options include immunochromatographic assays (ICA) for rapid screening and serology to detect antibodies, though serology only indicates exposure rather than active infection [1]. Veterinarians may also conduct fluorescein stain tests to reveal eye lesions and collect samples from the conjunctiva for laboratory analysis [2]. For comprehensive diagnosis, the cat's medical history should be reviewed, including recent exposure to other cats or boarding facilities [2].

## Treatment Options

Treatment of Feline Calicivirus (FCV) focuses on supportive care since there is no specific antiviral treatment. Based on the source material, here are the key treatment approaches:

Supportive therapy is essential and includes:
- Fluid therapy to treat dehydration and restore electrolyte balance in severely affected cats
- Providing highly palatable, blended or warmed food for anorexic cats
- Mucolytic drugs like bromhexine or nebulization with saline to provide respiratory relief
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infections in severely affected cases

Additional nursing care involves:
- Keeping cats' nose and eyes clean
- Using vaporizers to help clear nasal passages 
- Maintaining good nutrition, with force feeding if necessary
- Providing plenty of fluids and rest

Special considerations:
- Severely affected cats may need hospitalization for intensive nursing care
- Cats that haven't eaten for over 3 days may require IV fluids and nutrition
- Pain management may be needed for cats with oral ulcers
- Isolation from other cats is important to prevent spread

Based on the source materials, I'll write the Preventive Measures section for FCV infection:

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is a crucial component in preventing FCV infection, though it may not provide complete protection. Both modified-live and inactivated vaccines are available, with a recommended primary vaccination schedule of two doses at 9 and 12 weeks of age, followed by a first booster at 1 year [1]. In high-risk situations, a third vaccination at 16 weeks is advised. While low-risk cats can receive boosters every 3 years, those in high-risk environments like catteries or boarding facilities should be vaccinated annually [1,2].

Environmental management is essential since FCV can survive on surfaces for up to 28 days. Effective disinfection protocols should include thorough cleaning followed by appropriate disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite (2,700 ppm) or accelerated hydrogen peroxide [3]. In multi-cat environments, new cats should be quarantined and tested before introduction to the general population [4].

Additional preventive measures include:
- Regular health screening of all cats
- Isolation of infected cats
- Proper ventilation
- Maintaining good hygiene practices
- Reducing stress in multi-cat environments [5]

## Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating potential FCV infection, veterinarians must consider several other diseases that can present with similar clinical signs. Based on the source material, respiratory infections and oral conditions that need to be differentiated from FCV include [1,2]:

Feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) infection presents comparable upper respiratory signs but tends to primarily affect the conjunctivae and nasal passages, while FCV more commonly impacts the oral mucosa and lower respiratory tract. Even with these subtle differences, diagnosis between the two can be difficult as co-infections are common.

Chlamydophila felis typically causes chronic, low-grade conjunctivitis and occasional sneezing, making it an important differential when eye symptoms predominate. Mycoplasma felis infection similarly produces severe conjunctival edema with a milder rhinitis presentation.

For cases presenting with oral ulceration and respiratory symptoms, disinfectant toxicosis must be ruled out as it can mimic FCV signs. When systemic disease is present, feline infectious peritonitis should be considered as it may cause mild upper respiratory tract infection signs alongside more generalized symptoms.
