## Disease Overview

Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a severe viral disease caused by mutated strains of feline coronavirus (FCoV). While many cats are infected with the benign intestinal form of feline coronavirus (FeCV), only about 5-10% develop the fatal FIP disease when the virus mutates [1]. The disease occurs worldwide and affects cats of all ages, though it predominantly impacts young cats, with approximately 70% of cases diagnosed in cats under 1.5 years old and 50% in cats under 7 months [1].

Purebred cats appear to be at higher risk, particularly Persian, Abyssinian, Bengal, Birman, Himalayan, Ragdoll, and Rex breeds [5]. The disease is more prevalent in high-density cat populations like shelters and catteries, where coronavirus transmission is common [1]. Transmission typically occurs through the fecal-oral route, with cats becoming infected by ingesting or inhaling viral particles from contaminated litter boxes, food bowls, or through close contact [5].

FIP manifests in two main forms - a "wet" form characterized by fluid accumulation in body cavities, and a "dry" form affecting organs like the liver, kidneys, eyes and brain [1]. While historically considered uniformly fatal, recent developments in antiviral treatments have provided hope for affected cats [1,5]. The disease remains an important clinical challenge, with studies indicating approximately 1 in 200 new feline cases at veterinary teaching hospitals involve FIP diagnoses [4].

## Common Pathogens

Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) primarily develops from mutations of feline coronavirus (FCoV), which exists in two key forms. The first is feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), a generally harmless form that infects intestinal cells and is commonly found in cats. The second is the mutated form that causes FIP, known as FIPV [1,4].

The mutation process is critical - during replication in a cat's intestinal tract, FECV can spontaneously mutate, enabling the virus to infect and replicate within macrophages (immune system cells). This mutated form then spreads throughout the cat's body, causing widespread inflammation and the disease we know as FIP [1,2].

There are two distinct serotypes of FCoV:
- Serotype I: The predominant form in North America and Europe
- Serotype II: More closely related to canine coronavirus and predominant in Japan [2]

While FCoV is the primary pathogen, other coronaviruses can affect cats, including canine coronavirus (CCV). Research has shown that CCV can experimentally cause both enteritis and FIP in cats, though this is not common in natural settings [2,4].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

FIP manifests in two primary forms - wet (effusive) and dry (non-effusive), with distinct clinical presentations. In the wet form, cats develop noticeable fluid accumulation in the abdomen and/or chest cavity, leading to a distended belly and potential breathing difficulties. About one-third of cats with the wet form experience respiratory issues [1].

The dry form typically progresses more slowly and affects various organs including the liver, kidneys, eyes, and brain. Common symptoms across both forms include persistent fever lasting 2-5 weeks, loss of appetite, weight loss, and depression. Some cats may show initial mild signs like diarrhea, vomiting, and upper respiratory symptoms [2].

Neurological involvement is common, particularly in the dry form, resulting in poor muscle coordination, partial paralysis, seizures, and behavioral changes. Eye-related symptoms can include bleeding, pus accumulation, and vision problems. Additionally, about 50% of cats show signs related to abdominal organ involvement, affecting the kidneys, liver, spleen, pancreas, and lymph nodes [3].

The disease progression varies between forms - the wet form typically advances rapidly, while the dry form develops more gradually. Without treatment, FIP is usually progressive and fatal [4].

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosing FIP involves multiple diagnostic techniques since no single test is definitive. The key diagnostic approaches include clinical presentation evaluation, laboratory testing, and imaging studies [1].

For laboratory testing, complete blood count often reveals nonspecific changes like anemia, neutrophilia or neutropenia, and lymphopenia. Serum biochemistry typically shows increased total proteins, hyperglobulinemia, and potentially elevated liver enzymes or bilirubin. Analysis of effusions, when present, is highly diagnostic - the fluid is usually yellow, clear, and viscous with high protein content and pyogranulomatous inflammation [1].

Imaging plays an important role in diagnosis. Radiography and ultrasound can identify effusions and organ abnormalities. For cats with neurological signs, CT and MRI can reveal characteristic findings like hydrocephalus and meningeal enhancement [1,4].

More specific diagnostic tests include immunocytochemistry and PCR testing of effusions or tissue samples. While antibody testing is available, it has limited diagnostic value since it cannot differentiate between harmless coronavirus infection and FIP [4]. The most definitive diagnosis comes from histopathology with immunohistochemical staining of affected tissues, though this is often impractical ante-mortem [1].

## Treatment Options

Recent breakthroughs have transformed FIP from a fatal disease to a treatable condition, with antiviral medications showing success rates over 80% when started early [1]. The primary treatment approach centers on nucleoside analogues, particularly GS-441524 and its prodrug remdesivir, administered for a standard 84-day protocol [1,2]. A comprehensive treatment plan typically includes the antiviral medication along with supportive care such as anti-inflammatories, appetite stimulants, fluid therapy, immune support, anti-nausea medications, and pain management [1].

Treatment response is typically seen within 24-72 hours, with most cats returning to normal within 2-4 weeks [5]. While injectable forms were initially used, oral formulations are now available with veterinary prescription in some countries, making treatment more feasible for owners [4]. Treatment monitoring includes regular assessment of clinical signs, blood work, and body weight to ensure adequate response and adjust dosing if needed [3].

Some cases may require higher doses or extended treatment, particularly for neurological manifestations. While treatment success is high, factors like delayed diagnosis, inadequate dosing, or underlying conditions can affect outcomes [5]. Alternative antivirals like molnupiravir are being investigated as potential treatment options, though GS-441524 remains the first-line choice [1].

## Preventive Measures

While preventing FIP remains challenging, several key measures can help reduce the risk of infection and disease development. The most important preventive strategy is reducing exposure to feline coronavirus (FCoV) in multi-cat environments through proper management practices. Maintaining clean litter boxes and keeping them separate from feeding areas can help minimize FCoV transmission [1].

Currently, only one intranasal FIP vaccine is available, though it is considered non-core and has limited effectiveness. The vaccine may benefit kittens who haven't been exposed to FCoV, particularly before entering FCoV-endemic environments [2]. However, there are concerns about traditional vaccines potentially causing antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), which can worsen disease outcomes [3].

Promising research is underway on new vaccine approaches. Scientists at UC Davis are developing an mRNA-based vaccine that targets internal viral proteins rather than surface proteins, potentially avoiding the ADE problem seen with previous vaccines. This novel approach aims to help kittens mount an effective immune response before the virus can develop into FIP [3].

For now, the focus should remain on environmental management and isolation protocols, especially in shelters and catteries where FCoV exposure is common.

## Differential Diagnosis

The diagnosis of Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) requires careful differentiation from other conditions with similar clinical signs. In cats presenting with effusions, other causes of fluid accumulation like cardiac disease, neoplasia, or bacterial infections need to be ruled out [1]. For neurological manifestations of FIP, conditions such as toxoplasmosis, lymphoma, or other infectious diseases should be considered in the diagnostic process [2].

The presence of uveitis, a common FIP symptom, can also be caused by other infectious agents, trauma, or immune-mediated conditions. When non-specific signs like fever, lethargy and weight loss are present, a systematic diagnostic approach is needed since these symptoms overlap with many other feline diseases [3].

Key to differentiation is analyzing effusion characteristics when present, as FIP typically produces a protein-rich exudate with specific cellular properties. Advanced diagnostic testing including PCR for viral mutations, immunostaining of tissues/fluids, and evaluation of multiple clinical parameters in combination provides the most reliable way to distinguish FIP from other conditions [4]. A definitive diagnosis often requires integrating multiple test results along with clinical presentation.
