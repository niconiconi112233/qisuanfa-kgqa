## Disease Overview

Ascariasis is one of the most common parasitic infections affecting companion animals globally, particularly in dogs and cats. The main causative agents are Toxocara canis in dogs and Toxocara cati in cats, with Toxascaris leonina potentially infecting both species [1,2]. These large roundworms reside in the small intestine of infected animals and can grow to over 10 cm in length [2].

The infection is especially concerning in young animals, with studies showing that up to 30% of puppies under 6 months may be shedding T. canis eggs, and almost all puppies are born infected [2]. While adult pets often show minimal symptoms, puppies and kittens can experience serious health impacts including failure to thrive, poor coat condition, pot-bellied appearance, and in severe cases, death [2,3].

The disease spreads through multiple routes - ingestion of larvated eggs from contaminated environments, ingestion of infected tissues from other hosts, and notably for T. canis, transmission from mother to puppies both in utero and through nursing [2,4]. This complex transmission pattern, combined with the parasites' environmental resilience, makes ascariasis a persistent challenge requiring regular monitoring and preventive care in companion animals.

## Common Pathogens

The main causative agents of Ascariasis in dogs and cats are roundworms belonging to the Toxocara genus. The most important species are Toxocara canis, which primarily infects dogs, and Toxocara cati, which primarily infects cats [1,2]. Toxocara canis is considered the most common ascarid in dogs, while T. cati is the most prevalent species affecting cats [1,2]. An additional species, Toxascaris leonina, can infect both dogs and cats but is generally less common than the Toxocara species [2]. In parts of eastern Asia, cats may also be infected by Toxocara malaysiensis, though its zoonotic potential remains unclear [2].

These parasitic worms are large cream-colored nematodes that reside in the small intestine of infected animals. Adult T. canis worms typically range from 10-15 cm in length, while T. cati adults are slightly smaller at 3-10 cm [2]. The eggs from these ascarids are common environmental contaminants due to infected pets shedding them in their feces [3]. Both T. canis and T. cati are considered zoonotic pathogens, meaning they can cause significant disease in humans as well as pets [3].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Roundworm infections commonly present with more severe symptoms in puppies and kittens compared to adult animals. In young animals, the primary clinical signs include poor growth, weight loss, and a characteristic pot-bellied appearance [1,2]. Animals may also exhibit a dull, poor quality coat and failure to thrive [3].

Gastrointestinal symptoms are common, with affected animals experiencing diarrhea and vomiting. In some cases, adult worms may be visible in the vomit or feces [1,2]. Respiratory signs can occasionally occur during the larval migration phase, with some animals developing coughing [3].

While adult animals can harbor roundworm infections, they often show minimal or no clinical signs. However, severe infestations, particularly in young puppies, can lead to life-threatening complications including intestinal blockage [1]. The severity of symptoms generally correlates with the parasite burden - animals with higher worm counts typically display more pronounced clinical signs [3].

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosing ascariasis involves several key diagnostic techniques, with fecal examination being the primary method. The most reliable approach combines clinical assessment with laboratory testing to confirm the presence of parasites.

The main diagnostic tools include centrifugal fecal flotation, which is considered superior to simple flotation for detecting parasite eggs. This technique involves mixing feces with flotation medium, sieving through cheesecloth, centrifuging, and microscopically examining the sample. The test is particularly effective at detecting helminth eggs and protozoal cysts [1,2].

Direct fecal smear examination can be used as a quick screening method, though it is less sensitive due to the small sample size examined. For this test, a tiny amount of feces is mixed with saline solution and examined under a microscope immediately. Fresh samples (within 20 minutes of collection) are essential for accurate results [2,3].

For accurate diagnosis, proper sample collection and handling are crucial. Fecal samples should be as fresh as possible and refrigerated if they cannot be examined within 2 hours. Samples exposed to soil or grass for extended periods are unsuitable as they may be contaminated with free-living nematodes. Additionally, a single negative result does not definitively rule out infection - three samples collected over 7-10 days may be needed for conclusive results [1,2].

## Treatment Options

Effective treatment of ascariasis in dogs and cats involves a combination of anthelmintic medications and supportive care. Several safe and effective drug classes are available for treating roundworm infections [1,2].

For dogs, approved medications include fenbendazole, milbemycin, moxidectin, piperazine, and pyrantel. These can be given as single doses or multiple treatments 10-14 days apart depending on the specific drug. Monthly heartworm preventatives containing milbemycin, moxidectin or ivermectin also help control roundworm infections [2].

In cats, treatment options include emodepside, eprinomectin, fenbendazole, milbemycin, moxidectin, piperazine, pyrantel and selamectin. As with dogs, some drugs only kill adult worms and require two treatments 10-14 days apart [2].

Follow-up fecal exams should be performed 7-14 days after treatment to confirm efficacy. For pregnant animals, treating the mother helps prevent transmission to offspring. Puppies and kittens should be dewormed starting at 2 weeks of age and repeated every 2 weeks for 4 treatments [2,5].

Proper hygiene and environmental control measures are also important, including prompt removal of feces and rodent control since they can serve as transport hosts. Regular preventive treatment with broad-spectrum anthelmintics helps stop egg shedding into the environment [2,5].

Based on the source material, I will write a focused section on preventive measures for Ascariasis.

## Preventive Measures

The prevention of Ascariasis requires a multi-faceted approach focusing on sanitation, hygiene, and environmental management. Regular deworming with appropriate antiparasitic medications is a key preventive strategy recommended by veterinarians for both dogs and cats [1,2]. Environmental control is critical and includes promptly removing feces from yards, litter boxes, and public areas to prevent egg development in soil. Regular cleaning and disinfection of animal housing areas and bedding is also essential.

Proper hygiene practices are vital, including thorough hand washing after handling pets or cleaning up their waste. Pet owners should prevent their animals from hunting rodents or consuming uncooked meat that may contain parasitic larvae [2]. For facilities housing multiple animals, isolation protocols should be implemented for new arrivals or infected animals to prevent transmission.

Client education plays an important role - veterinarians should inform pet owners about transmission routes, proper sanitation methods, and the importance of regular preventive treatments [2]. Special attention should be paid to environments where puppies and kittens are present, as they are more susceptible to infection.

## Differential Diagnosis

Several conditions can present with symptoms similar to Ascariasis and need to be carefully differentiated. In the early respiratory phase, Ascariasis may be confused with other causes of eosinophilic pneumonia, including infections with Filariasis, Strongyloides, hookworm, Toxocara, and schistosomiasis [1]. The presence of respiratory symptoms like coughing, wheezing, and dyspnea along with characteristic migratory bilateral round infiltrates on imaging and peripheral eosinophilia can help differentiate pulmonary ascariasis [2].

For intestinal manifestations, other parasitic infections should be considered due to frequent coinfection and similar epidemiologic factors. Common parasites to differentiate include hookworms, whipworms, pinworms, and Strongyloides [3]. Additionally, non-parasitic conditions that can present similarly include malabsorption from various causes, intestinal obstruction from adhesions or tumors, and biliary obstruction from gallstones or strictures [3].

In cases of biliary ascariasis, conditions like cholangitis, pancreatitis, and other biliary parasites (Clonorchis, Fasciola) need to be ruled out through appropriate imaging and laboratory testing [3]. The key is thorough diagnostic workup including stool microscopy to identify characteristic eggs, relevant imaging, and consideration of epidemiologic exposure history.
