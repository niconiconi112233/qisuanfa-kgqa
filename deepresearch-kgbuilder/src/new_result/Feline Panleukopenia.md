Based on the provided source material, I'll write a Disease Overview section for feline panleukopenia.

## Disease Overview

Feline panleukopenia is a highly contagious and potentially fatal viral disease that affects domestic cats and other felids worldwide [1,2]. The disease is caused by feline parvovirus (FPV), a single-stranded DNA virus that is closely related to canine parvovirus [3]. It primarily affects young cats between 4 weeks and 2 years of age, with kittens being most severely impacted [4].

The virus targets and destroys rapidly dividing cells in the bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, and intestinal epithelium. While vaccination has made the disease less common in pet cats with regular veterinary care, infection rates remain high in feral, free-roaming, and shelter cat populations with limited access to preventive care [5]. The virus is extremely hardy and can persist in the environment for up to 1 year under favorable conditions, making it particularly challenging to control in shelter settings.

Infected cats typically develop symptoms such as high fever, severe depression, vomiting, diarrhea, and severe dehydration. Without proper treatment, mortality rates are significant - survival rates for hospitalized cats range from only 20-51% [5]. Prevention through vaccination is highly effective when properly administered, providing long-lasting immunity against the disease.

## Causative Pathogens

Feline panleukopenia is primarily caused by feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus belonging to the family Parvoviridae and genus Parvovirus [1]. The virus is approximately 25nm in size and contains a genome of around 5000 bases. FPV is highly stable in the environment and can remain infectious for weeks after being shed [1].

While FPV is the main causative agent, some cases of feline panleukopenia can also result from infection with closely related viruses including mink enteritis virus (MEV) and certain variants of canine parvovirus (CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c) [1]. These viruses share a high degree of genetic similarity with FPV, particularly in their capsid proteins [1].

The virus requires host cell DNA polymerases and replication machinery to multiply, giving it a specific tropism for rapidly dividing cells [1]. It enters cells through endocytosis mediated by viral capsid proteins binding to host cell transferrin receptors [1]. FPV affects all felid species as well as some other carnivores like raccoons, mink and foxes [3].

Based on the source material, I'll write a section describing the clinical symptoms of feline panleukopenia.

## Clinical Symptoms

Feline panleukopenia typically presents with severe clinical signs that can progress rapidly. Initial symptoms include high fever (104-107°F), profound depression, and complete anorexia. Affected cats often exhibit vomiting, which usually develops 1-2 days after fever onset and is typically bilious and unrelated to eating. Some cats may show hypersalivation due to nausea and abdominal pain [1].

While diarrhea can occur, it is not always present and rarely contains blood, unlike in canine parvoviral infections. Physical examination typically reveals severe dehydration, with the skin losing elasticity and the coat becoming dull and rough. Cats may sit for long periods in front of water bowls without drinking [2].

In peracute cases, particularly in kittens, sudden death may be the first and only clinical sign noted. For cats that develop clinical disease, the course is typically 5-7 days, with a median survival time of about 3 days after hospital admission. Abdominal palpation often reveals thickened intestinal loops and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, and may trigger immediate vomiting [1, 2].

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosing feline panleukopenia involves multiple testing approaches. The primary diagnostic method is blood testing to detect severe leukopenia (white blood cell count often below 2,000 cells/µL), which is a hallmark sign of the disease [1]. Fecal testing using ELISA or PCR methods can detect viral particles, with PCR being more specific. While canine parvovirus SNAP tests are commonly used off-label for quick in-clinic testing, recent vaccination may cause false positives [1,2].

Laboratory methods like virus isolation and electron microscopy can also confirm infection, though these require specialized equipment. The virus isolation approach uses feline cell cultures but has a longer turnaround time of about two weeks [4]. Immunofluorescent antibody staining of tissue samples, particularly intestinal tissue, can detect viral antigens through specific fluorescent markers [4].

For preventive screening and immunity assessment, antibody titer testing is available to measure protection levels, especially useful after vaccination or in outbreak situations [5]. In deceased cats, postmortem tissue analysis revealing characteristic intestinal damage and lymphoid depletion can definitively confirm infection [1].

## Treatment Options

Treatment of feline panleukopenia requires intensive supportive care, with fluid therapy being the cornerstone of treatment. Intravenous balanced isotonic crystalloid solutions with potassium supplementation are essential for addressing fluid deficits and maintaining hydration. Antiemetic therapy, particularly maropitant (1 mg/kg SC/IV daily), helps control vomiting and allows earlier feeding [1].

Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is crucial to prevent secondary bacterial infections, with a focus on targeting anaerobes and gram-negative bacteria. Common combinations include ampicillin sulbactam with fluoroquinolones or third-generation cephalosporins. Anthelmintic treatment should be initiated once vomiting is controlled [1].

Additional supportive measures include B vitamin supplementation, monitoring for hypoglycemia, and careful nutritional support with small, frequent meals once vomiting is controlled. Fresh-frozen plasma or whole blood transfusions may be beneficial for cats with severe anemia or clotting issues [1].

Newer treatment options being explored include immune-targeted therapies like filgrastim, though evidence of efficacy is limited. Without treatment, mortality rates are high - survival rates for hospitalized cats range from 20-51% with supportive care [1].

## Preventive Measures

Vaccination is the cornerstone of FPV prevention. All cats, including indoor-only cats, should receive a core vaccination series consisting of two injections given at 8-9 weeks of age and 3-4 weeks later, followed by a first booster after one year [1]. Kittens in high-risk environments like shelters or from queens with high antibody levels may need a third vaccination at 16-20 weeks [1].

Environmental control is crucial since the virus can survive for months. Proper disinfection using products containing sodium hypochlorite (bleach), peracetic acid, formaldehyde, or sodium hydroxide is essential [1]. Facilities should implement strict isolation protocols for infected cats and maintain thorough sanitation practices [2].

Population management strategies are vital in shelter settings to prevent transmission. This includes separating animals into smaller groups based on health status and age, minimizing crowding, and maintaining proper housing design that allows for cleaning without direct handling [3]. All new cats entering shelters should be vaccinated immediately at intake, as the vaccine can provide immunity within hours [3].

## Differential Diagnosis

Feline panleukopenia must be carefully differentiated from several other conditions that can present with similar clinical signs. The most important differentials include other viral enteritides, bacterial infections, and parasitic diseases [1,2]. 

Common viral differentials include feline enteric coronavirus, feline calicivirus, and feline leukemia virus. In vaccinated adult cats showing signs of panleukopenia, concurrent FeLV infection should be specifically investigated [3].

Bacterial infections like salmonellosis can mimic the gastrointestinal and systemic signs. Parasitic infections, particularly severe cases of gastrointestinal parasitism, should also be considered [4]. In cases with neurological signs, congenital central nervous system defects need to be ruled out.

Other important differentials include toxin exposure, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, pancreatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. In community cat outbreaks, the high mortality rate can sometimes be mistaken for mass poisoning [5].

A presumptive diagnosis can often be made based on compatible clinical signs in juvenile or unvaccinated cats with likely exposure history. However, confirmation typically requires laboratory testing, particularly in vaccinated adult cats or atypical presentations.
