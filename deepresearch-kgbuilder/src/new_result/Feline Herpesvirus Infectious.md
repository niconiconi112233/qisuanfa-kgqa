## Disease Overview

Feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) is one of the most prevalent viral infections affecting cats worldwide [1]. The virus belongs to the family Herpesviridae and causes feline viral rhinotracheitis, a significant upper respiratory tract disease [5]. As an alphaherpesvirus, FHV-1 establishes lifelong latent infections in nerve tissues, particularly in the trigeminal ganglia, after primary infection [5].

The virus spreads mainly through direct contact with infected cats or their secretions, with transmission also possible via contaminated surfaces [1]. In healthy small populations, viral shedding prevalence may be less than 1%, but this can increase to 20% in larger populations with clinical signs present [5]. The risk is particularly high in shelters, where initial shedding rates of 4% can escalate to 50% within a week [5].

FHV-1 primarily infects epithelial cells of the conjunctiva and upper respiratory tract, causing tissue damage through viral replication and inflammatory responses [5]. Almost all cats experiencing primary infection become lifelong carriers, with the virus capable of reactivating during periods of stress, leading to recurring episodes of viral shedding and potential clinical disease [5]. While antibodies provide some protection, they do not prevent reinfection, making this a challenging infection to control completely [5].

## Common Pathogens

Feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) is the primary pathogen responsible for feline viral rhinotracheitis, a widespread viral disease affecting domestic and wild cats globally. This alphaherpesvirus belongs to the Herpesviridae family and is highly contagious [1,3]. The virus specifically targets epithelial tissues, demonstrating a strong epitheliotropic and cytopathic nature [2].

FHV-1 primarily infects the upper respiratory system and ocular tissues, causing rhinitis and conjunctivitis. In some cases, the infection can progress to cause pneumonia, though this is less common [2]. One of the most significant characteristics of FHV-1 is its ability to establish lifelong latency in the host, particularly in sensory neuronal cells [3].

The virus's pathogenesis is complex, as it can remain dormant after the initial acute infection and later reactivate, leading to recurrent disease episodes [3,4]. This pattern of latency and reactivation is common throughout domestic cat populations worldwide, though not all infected cats develop chronic or recurrent disease [4].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Feline herpesvirus typically causes acute upper respiratory and ocular disease, with symptoms being particularly severe in young kittens [1]. The typical signs develop in two main areas - respiratory and ocular manifestations. Initial symptoms include sneezing, salivation and coughing, followed by fever, depression, and loss of appetite [1].

The respiratory signs involve nasal congestion and discharge that ranges from clear and watery to thick and purulent when secondary bacterial infections develop [1]. The ocular manifestations include conjunctivitis with redness and discharge, excessive blinking, and squinting [1]. In some cases, the virus can cause corneal ulcers, with dendritic (branching) ulcers being considered a hallmark sign of FHV infection [1,3].

Some cats may develop more severe complications like pneumonia with systemic illness. Less commonly, dermatitis with skin ulcers around the nose and mouth can occur [1]. Chronic or recurrent cases may lead to ongoing rhinitis with persistent sneezing and nasal discharge [1]. The virus typically causes acute disease lasting 10-14 days, though some animals develop chronic lesions in the upper respiratory tract and eyes [3].

## Diagnostic Methods

The diagnosis of feline herpesvirus infection requires a combination of clinical assessment and laboratory confirmation. The most reliable diagnostic method is laboratory testing performed on swabs collected from oral, nasal, or ocular discharge sites [1]. Blood tests are not considered an accurate diagnostic tool for this condition.

Clinical presentation plays a key role in diagnosis, with conjunctivitis and keratitis being the most common ocular manifestations [2]. The only truly pathognomonic clinical sign is the presence of dendritic corneal lesions, though these are often transient and may only be visible with rose bengal staining [3].

Diagnostic interpretation can be challenging for several reasons. The virus can be detected in up to half of normal cats without active disease, and viral presence may be a consequence rather than cause of clinical signs. Additionally, current diagnostic tests cannot differentiate between vaccine and wild-type virus [3]. Given these limitations, veterinarians often rely on maintaining a strong clinical suspicion of FHV-1 in cats presenting with surface ocular disease while considering the characteristic clinical features in context with diagnostic test results.

## Treatment Options

The treatment of feline herpesvirus infection requires a multi-faceted approach combining antiviral medications, supportive care, and nursing support [1,2]. For moderate to severe cases, topical antiviral medications like trifluridine 1%, idoxuridine 0.2%, or cidofovir 0.5% are important, especially when corneal surfaces are compromised. Cidofovir is often preferred as it only needs to be administered every 12 hours [2].

Oral famciclovir is another effective antiviral option, though optimal dosing varies. Common protocols range from 125mg to 500mg given 2-3 times daily, with the specific dose balanced against patient compliance and cost factors [2]. For severe cases requiring intensive care, supportive therapy includes maintaining hydration, restoring electrolytes, and managing acid-base balance through intravenous fluids [1].

Pain management is also crucial and may include lubricating artificial tears, oral pain medications like buprenorphine or gabapentin, and in some cases topical atropine for severe ocular discomfort [2]. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are typically prescribed to prevent secondary bacterial infections, with common choices being oxytetracycline, erythromycin ointment, or tobramycin drops administered three times daily [2].

## Preventive Measures

Effective prevention of feline herpesvirus infection requires a multi-faceted approach combining vaccination and environmental management strategies [1,2]. Core vaccination starting in kittens is essential, with two initial doses given at 9 and 12 weeks of age, followed by a first booster one year later [1]. For at-risk cats like those with outdoor access, annual boosters are recommended, while indoor-only cats in low-risk situations can receive boosters every 3 years [1].

Environmental management is also crucial for prevention. Since the virus spreads through direct contact with infected cats and contaminated objects, good hygiene practices and disinfection are important [2]. The virus is relatively fragile and susceptible to most disinfectants and detergents [1]. In multi-cat environments, separating infected cats and using proper sanitation can help reduce transmission risk.

For high-risk environments like shelters and catteries, vaccination is considered core and should be administered before or at entry [1]. When possible, a series of vaccinations should be given every 2-3 weeks starting at 4 weeks of age up to 5 months [1]. This helps provide optimal protection in vulnerable populations where disease outbreaks can occur rapidly.

## Differential Diagnosis

Several diseases must be differentiated from feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) infection due to overlapping clinical signs. The main differential diagnoses include feline calicivirus (FCV), which primarily affects the oral mucosa and lower respiratory tract, while FHV-1 tends to affect the conjunctivae and nasal passages [1,2]. Bacterial infections such as Bordetella bronchiseptica, Mycoplasma species, Streptococcus species, and Chlamydia felis must also be considered [1,3]. 

Chlamydia felis typically produces chronic, low-grade conjunctivitis with occasional sneezing, while Mycoplasma infections result in severe conjunctival edema and mild rhinitis [3]. Other causes of rhinitis that need to be ruled out include fungal infections like cryptococcosis and aspergillosis, as well as neoplasia and foreign bodies [1].

The only pathognomonic sign of FHV-1 infection is the presence of dendritic corneal lesions, though these are often transient and may only be visible with special staining [3]. Clinical suspicion should remain high for FHV-1 since it accounts for the majority of feline keratoconjunctivitis cases along with Chlamydophila felis [3].
