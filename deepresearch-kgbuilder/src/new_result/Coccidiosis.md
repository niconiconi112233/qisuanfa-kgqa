Here's my synthesized section on Disease Overview for coccidiosis:

## Disease Overview

Coccidiosis is a widespread parasitic disease caused by single-celled protozoan parasites belonging to the genera Eimeria and Isospora within the phylum Apicomplexa [1,2]. These obligate intracellular parasites primarily invade and destroy the intestinal epithelial lining and underlying connective tissue of the host animal's digestive tract [1,2].

The disease occurs universally and affects a wide range of animals, but is most commonly seen in young animals between 1-3 months of age when housed or confined in small areas contaminated with parasite oocysts [2,5]. While infection rates are typically high in farm animals, clinical disease usually only develops in 5-10% of infected animals, often triggered by stressors like poor nutrition, overcrowding, sudden feed changes, or severe weather [5].

The main clinical sign is diarrhea, which may be accompanied by dehydration, decreased growth, and in severe cases, tissue damage and hemorrhage into the intestinal lumen [2]. Most animals develop natural immunity after exposure, though they can still harbor subclinical infections that maintain parasite presence in the environment [2]. While mortality rates are generally low, coccidiosis remains economically significant in production animals due to reduced feed efficiency and growth performance [2].

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

The main clinical sign of coccidiosis in companion animals is diarrhea, which can range from mild to severe. Young animals, particularly puppies and kittens aged 4-12 weeks, are most commonly affected and show more serious symptoms [1,2]. Severely affected animals may present with watery or bloody diarrhea, accompanied by lethargy, dehydration, weight loss, vomiting, and abdominal pain [2,3].

While many adult pets remain asymptomatic when infected, immunocompromised animals or those under stress are more likely to develop clinical disease [3,4]. The onset of symptoms typically occurs about 2 weeks after infection in puppies. In kittens, illness most commonly develops during weaning periods when they experience increased stress [4].

In severe cases, particularly in young or debilitated animals, the infection can lead to serious complications including severe dehydration and, rarely, death if left untreated [2,3]. The severity of symptoms often correlates with the extent of intestinal damage and inflammation caused by the parasites invading the intestinal lining [1].

## Diagnostic Methods

The primary method for diagnosing coccidiosis is through microscopic examination of fecal samples. Centrifugal flotation is considered the most sensitive and reliable technique, being superior to simple flotation methods [1,2]. For accurate diagnosis, fecal samples should be as fresh as possible and examined within 2 hours of collection, or refrigerated immediately if there will be a delay [3].

A fecal flotation test involves mixing a small amount of feces with a high-specific-gravity flotation solution (usually between 1.18-1.33) and examining it under a microscope to identify coccidia oocysts [2]. During centrifugal flotation, approximately 1 teaspoon of feces is mixed with the flotation medium, strained, centrifuged, and examined microscopically using 10x magnification [2].

Direct fecal smear examination can also be performed but is less sensitive due to the small sample size evaluated [2]. For animals showing clinical signs, a single negative fecal test is insufficient to rule out infection - three samples collected over 7-10 days are recommended for accurate diagnosis [2]. Commercial ELISA tests are also available and can be more sensitive than a single flotation test, though they only detect one specific pathogen [2].

## Treatment Options

Treatment for coccidiosis typically involves both specific medications and supportive care. The most commonly prescribed medications are sulfa-based antibiotics, with sulfadimethoxine (AlbonÂ®) being the primary treatment choice. This is typically administered at 50 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 25 mg/kg daily for 5-20 days or until symptoms resolve plus an additional 2-3 days [1,2].

Newer treatment options include coccidiocidal medications like ponazuril (20-50 mg/kg) and toltrazuril (10-30 mg/kg), which can clear the infection in just a few doses. These medications have proven effective and safe in shelter environments where coccidiosis is common [1,3].

Supportive care is essential, particularly for severely affected animals. This includes fluid therapy to address dehydration, nutritional support for animals with poor appetite, and maintaining warmth in young animals [4]. Environmental management is also crucial - infected animals should be kept in clean, disinfected areas with prompt removal of feces to prevent reinfection [2].

Based on the provided source material, I'll write the Preventive Measures section for coccidiosis.

## Preventive Measures

Effective prevention of coccidiosis requires a multi-faceted approach combining environmental management, biosecurity protocols, and vaccination strategies. Environmental factors play a crucial role in controlling the disease. Proper ventilation must be maintained to prevent wet litter conditions that facilitate oocyst sporulation. Stocking density should be carefully monitored, as overcrowding increases disease risk through higher oocyst concentration and competition for food and water [1].

Strict biosecurity measures are essential and should include thorough cleaning and disinfection of poultry houses, proper removal of contaminated litter, and restricted access to affected areas. Regular monitoring of flock health and maintaining accurate vaccination records are also critical components [2].

Vaccination has emerged as a key preventive strategy, particularly for commercial flocks. Both precocious and non-precocious vaccines are available, with each type offering different advantages. Non-precocious vaccines provide more complete protection against field challenges, while precocious vaccines have a shorter lifecycle. For optimal results, vaccination should be combined with other control measures rather than used as a standalone solution [2].

Nutritional management also plays an important role in prevention. Proper protein levels, vitamin supplementation (especially vitamins A, E, and K), and mineral balance can help reduce coccidiosis impact and support immune response. Monitoring feed quality and ensuring adequate feeding space are essential preventive measures [2].

## Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating cases of diarrhea, several other conditions should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis, including:

Small bowel causes:
- Dietary indiscretion and dietary changes [1]
- Parasitic infections (roundworms, Giardia, coccidia) [1]
- Inflammatory bowel disease [1]
- Bacterial infections (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Clostridium) [1]
- Primary GI disorders like exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [1]

Large bowel causes:
- Colitis [2]
- Inflammatory bowel disease affecting colon [2]
- Colorectal masses or polyps [2]
- Fiber-responsive disorders [2]

Systemic causes:
- Liver disease [1]
- Kidney disease [1]
- Hypoadrenocorticism [1]
- Hyperthyroidism in cats [1]
- Pancreatitis [1]

Careful diagnostic workup is needed to differentiate between these causes, as treatment approaches vary significantly depending on the underlying etiology. Physical exam findings, laboratory testing, and response to therapy help narrow down the differential list.
