## Disease Overview

Trichomoniasis in pets is primarily caused by Tritrichomonas foetus (T. foetus), a flagellate protozoan parasite that was definitively identified as the cause of trichomonal diarrhea in cats in 2003 [1]. The disease predominantly affects cats, with dogs being rarely infected, and is most prevalent in young, purebred cats housed in crowded environments like catteries [2].

The organism is transmitted through the fecal-oral route and can survive in moist environments for hours to days. Studies have shown T. foetus can persist for up to 30 minutes on dry cat food, several hours in moist cat food, and days in cat feces [2]. Shared litter boxes and mutual grooming facilitate transmission between cats.

Epidemiological studies indicate significant prevalence - one U.S. study found 31% of cats from catteries were infected, while a U.K. study detected T. foetus in 14.4% of cats with diarrhea [2]. Risk factors include living in crowded facilities, being purebred, and having concurrent infections with other organisms like Giardia or Cryptosporidium [2]. The infection has been documented worldwide, though cats in multi-cat environments and catteries are most commonly affected, with feral cats rarely infected [2].

Based on the source material, I'll write the Common Pathogens section focusing on the key organisms causing trichomoniasis in companion animals.

## Common Pathogens

The primary pathogen causing trichomoniasis in companion animals is Tritrichomonas foetus (T. foetus), a flagellate protozoan belonging to the phylum Sarcomastigophora and order Trichomonadida [1]. This single-celled organism has three anterior flagella and measures 10-26 μm long by 3-5 μm wide, featuring a distinctive undulating membrane that aids in its movement [1].

In cats, which are more commonly affected than dogs, T. foetus specifically targets the gastrointestinal system, primarily colonizing the ileum, cecum, and colon [1]. While genetically similar to bovine strains, feline T. foetus shows host adaptation, with feline strains being more effective at causing diarrhea in cats compared to bovine isolates [1].

Another species, Pentatrichomonas hominis, can also be found in cats and dogs, though its role in causing disease is less clear [2]. Careful morphological examination or PCR testing is required to differentiate between these organisms [2]. The parasites reproduce through binary fission and do not form resistant cysts, though they can survive briefly in moist environments [1,2].

Based on the source material, I'll write a comprehensive section on the clinical symptoms and signs of trichomoniasis in cats and dogs.

## Clinical Symptoms and Signs

Trichomoniasis most commonly affects cats, particularly young cats and kittens, with symptoms ranging from subclinical infection to chronic intractable diarrhea [1,3]. The most prominent clinical sign is chronic large bowel diarrhea, which may contain blood and mucus, often accompanied by fecal incontinence and anal swelling [1,4].

While infected cats typically maintain good appetite and body condition, they may experience frequent bowel movements with semi-formed to liquid, foul-smelling stools [3,4]. Additional symptoms can include flatulence, straining to defecate, and perianal swelling. Some cats may develop less common signs such as vomiting, abdominal pain, or failure to gain weight [3].

The diarrhea often follows a waxing and waning pattern, with episodes that can persist for weeks to months or even years [1]. Many cats experience spontaneous resolution of symptoms within 5 months to 2 years, though they may still carry the infection and experience relapses during times of stress [3,4].

Importantly, many infected cats remain asymptomatic carriers, particularly those in catteries, showing no clinical signs despite testing positive for the organism [1]. Systemic illness is rare, with most cats remaining active and playful despite their gastrointestinal symptoms [1].

## Diagnostic Methods

The diagnosis of trichomoniasis relies on several key testing methods and clinical observations. The primary diagnostic approach involves detecting trichomonad organisms in smegma or preputial flush samples, either through direct microscopic examination or PCR testing [1]. 

For culture-based diagnosis, samples must be collected with exacting care using sterile equipment. The collection process involves obtaining smegma from the glans penis through vigorous scraping (approximately 30 strokes) of both the preputial and glans penis mucosa. These samples can be collected using either a "wet" or "dry" method and must be transported in specialized media like TF InPouch or TF-Transit tubes [1].

PCR testing offers a more definitive diagnostic option, with samples being viable for testing if they reach the lab within 72 hours of collection. Veterinarians can choose between a single negative individual PCR or a single negative pooled PCR test. However, pooled PCR testing is not recommended for confirmed positive herds or those exposed to trichomoniasis [1].

Proper sample handling is crucial - specimens should be maintained at room temperature (65-80°F) during collection and shipment, avoiding direct sunlight and temperature extremes. Test results typically have a turnaround time of 5-7 business days once received by the laboratory [1].

## Treatment Options

Treatment of trichomoniasis primarily involves antiprotozoal medications combined with supportive care measures. The standard medication approach uses nitroimidazole drugs, with metronidazole being the most common first-line treatment [1,2]. The typical regimen involves either metronidazole 500mg twice daily for 7 days or a single 2g dose [2,3].

For supportive care, dietary modifications like increasing fiber intake can help firm up stool consistency. Probiotics may also be beneficial in restoring healthy gastrointestinal flora. Some patients, particularly those experiencing dehydration, may require fluid therapy [2].

Treatment success rates with recommended metronidazole regimens range from 84-98%. An alternative medication option is tinidazole, which has shown cure rates of 92-100% [3]. However, treatment resistance can occur in 4-10% of cases, requiring alternative approaches or longer treatment durations [3].

Clinical signs are often self-limiting even without treatment, but may take months to fully resolve [3]. Ongoing monitoring for 2-3 weeks after treatment is recommended to ensure resolution. The overall prognosis is good with appropriate medical management, though reinfection is possible if preventive measures aren't followed [2].

Based on the source material, I'll write a section on Preventive Measures for trichomoniasis infections.

## Preventive Measures

Several key strategies can help prevent trichomoniasis infections and control its spread. Vaccination is one preventive option, though available vaccines are not 100% effective. When used, initial vaccination should be given 8 weeks before breeding, followed by a second dose 4 weeks prior to breeding. Previously vaccinated animals should receive annual boosters 4 weeks before breeding [1].

Strict isolation and biosecurity measures are essential components of prevention. Infected animals should be kept separate from healthy ones, and shared equipment or facilities should be avoided. For cats specifically, infected individuals should be isolated from other cats and not share litter boxes [2].

Environmental management is also crucial for prevention. Common biosecurity strategies include utilizing artificial insemination, testing non-virgin animals before breeding seasons, limiting breeding seasons to 90 days or less, culling infected animals, and maintaining isolation from potentially infected herds [3]. Additionally, any new breeding animals added to a herd should come from known disease-free sources.

Multiple control measures must be implemented together, as vaccination alone cannot prevent disease spread [4]. A comprehensive prevention program combining vaccination, isolation, and proper environmental management offers the best protection against trichomoniasis infection.

## Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating cases of suspected trichomoniasis in pets, several other conditions with similar clinical presentations must be considered. Giardiasis is one of the main differential diagnoses, as both Giardia and Tritrichomonas can cause chronic diarrhea with similar clinical signs [1]. This is particularly important since these protozoan pathogens share surprisingly similar biological characteristics and are both clinically significant in veterinary medicine.

In cats specifically, other conditions that should be included in the differential diagnosis include inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, and bacterial infections that can cause chronic large bowel diarrhea [2]. The presence of blood and/or mucus in the stool along with large bowel inflammation is common with trichomoniasis but can also occur with these other conditions.

Age of onset can help differentiate, as trichomoniasis typically affects young cats between 0-24 months of age, with an average onset around 9 months [3]. The disease is also more prevalent in cattery cats compared to household pets. However, since many cats can be asymptomatic carriers while testing positive, diagnostic testing is essential for confirmation rather than relying solely on clinical signs.
